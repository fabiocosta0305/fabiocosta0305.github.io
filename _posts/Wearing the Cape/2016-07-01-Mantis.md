_Masked Riders_ are a kind of famous pre-Event _Tokusatsu_ (action series) where the hero was someone that, after undergone big body modifications, had turned into a kind of half-human insectoid monster, but still with a human heart and fight for justice.

Showa Takagi was an actor on an pre-Event _Masked Rider_ show, _Lotus Mantis_. He was in the setting when the Event happened. The problem is that at the same time a sequence of explosion would occur. He had undergone the breakthrough during it and changed into the form of _Lotus Mantis_, an humanoid mantis kind of guy, with a metal body and a sword... 

He had lots of time to control his transformation, but it was somewhat like what he did into the show. Now, Showa is one of the most famous _Sentai_ in Japan, part of _Heroes Without Borders_ and of 日本のヒーロー組織 (_Nihon no hīrō soshiki_, Japanese Hero Organization), being one of the founding members of the last one, and although still a civilian, he colaborates with Tokyo Police Department, the 警視庁 (_Keishichō_). He still has some problems with his form, but he had already developed his powers as a _Sentai_, and have multiple forms.
