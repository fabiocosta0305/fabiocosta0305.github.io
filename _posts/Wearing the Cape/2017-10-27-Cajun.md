Leon was always a great _Savateur_: from an old lineage of French combatant, he developed all his skills as a _Savateur_ to a big level, turning someone that could be won only by the biggest capes. He is somewhat recognized by others as one _Paragon_, the humanity-peak heroes that some time and another appears in the world after The Event. After a time at the French Armed Forces, including the _Légion Étrangère_ as a combat instructor, this Saint Louis born cape bacame part of _Herós Sans Frontiére_. After 2 years on the gig, he bacame a reservist and ocasionally trains and act besides _Jiminy Cricket_.

Leon uses a kind of Zorro-like costumed _integrale_ in black, with his crest, a _Fleur de Lis_ backing a rapier and a saber in white and a velvety _Manteur_ (cape) with his crest. He also uses a Zorro-like mask, blood red, showing green vibrant eyes Below the mask, his strawberry blonde hair is curled and styled Louis XV.

He's a flamboyant man and CAI-certificated hero, with _Panache_ enough to deal with the worst guys, except the most superpowered ones. He has an old-fashioned sens of duty, honor and justice, but he can understand that the times changed. However, he's just a little step to cross the line between a real hero or a vigilante.
