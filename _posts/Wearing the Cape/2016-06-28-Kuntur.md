Jose Marti is a descendant of the _quechua_, the indigenous people from Bolivia. He was a common kid that, like many other who grew immediately post-Event, grew dreaming about having powers. But, as his father, he was trained as a guide for hikers from all around the world that would want to get into the biggest peaks from Andes, either in his Bolivia motherland or in Argentina, Peru, Colombia or Ecuador.

It was this until, while guiding some hikers into the Aconcagua mountains, he fell into a rift. Before he could hit hard the ground to his death, he felt a great calmness in his heart, and feel like he was looking by the eyes of the condor. And then, we he came up to himself, he was back to the track, but he was somewhat over the ones he was guiding. He was flying!!!

Back to his community at Bolivia, the local quechua shaman did him come through a ritual, where he understood his powers and destiny: he was _Kuntur_, the Condor, and he should fly all the world fighting for justice like a hero, to bring back _quechua_ his fame of wise people, not the bloody fame of the Mexica (Aztec) that white people put over him.

He gone into Cuzco and volunteered himself to _Heroes Without Borders_, as it was the only people he believed like the people all around. 

He's now known as _Kuntur_ as his cape name, and now he lives for fighting for justice,.
