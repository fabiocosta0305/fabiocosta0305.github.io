They are able to travel through the memories of others ...  memories written in stationary paper like the one you hold in your hand. Furthermore, they can assume stanger forms, like those drawn on the papers._

> _Your parents also doubted when I shown myself to them..._

> _I know it's weird... But have you never wondered why your mother hold that large folder with sheets and more sheets of stationery paper? We can say that that folder is the source of her power, that she uses to help people._

>
> _She didn't fight something physical ... at least not normally._
>
> _Sometimes, people drown themselves into sadness and depression;  anger, and hatred and rancor; envy and excessive ambition; and when they write all this in the stationery paper, thinking they can send such negative feelings to others, they may end up trapping themselves into turning grotesque representations of what the hate or despise more, their worst fears and ambitions. We call these forms that they take_ **Projections**

>  _Everything you write and draw in paper, each drop of ink dipped into it, has power. The words, the pictures made on them, have power. Never wondered you when sometimes you say_ "I just want him to get hurt" _and that person got hurt? In your modern times, people have lost the feeling about the power of words. But in the ancient times, people took very careful about what they said:_ "Promises are as good as gold" _is an old saying with much more reason than you can understand ... This is why the_ **Fairies** _never take promises that easy, because once they made one, they must kept them._
>
>  "And there are really fairies?" _**(giggles)** Of course they are! The case is that humans no longer accept them. In the rational, logical, mathematical world with that people surronded themselves with due to fear of the unknown, they don't find explanations, therefore being end up "eliminated" by common sense. The normal attitude is: if you can't explain something, it does not exist within that rational mathematical world. Or ... How is that saying? Ah ..._ "Among competing hypotheses, the one with the fewest assumptions should be selected." _Occam's Razor, or_ lex parsimoniae. _This is a really true fact in many things. But for those who understand **The Power of Words** about saying the right word  the right way and in the right place, as you will still understand sooner or later, these creatures, aliens to those concepts, still exist and have power, a power that is accessible to those who understand the Power of the Words._
>
> _Is this power magic? No more than send someone into the space with a rocket or using a cellphone to communicate with people around the world. What you're learning, in fact, is something that anyone can learn. We can say that this is, in fact, Science, although onenot yet tamed, or that was pioneered and ignored by those who feared the Unknown. You are only being chosen by a fact: you listen more than talk and read more than write, so is more willing to understand that Power._
>
> _Take my paw ... Don't worry, you will not be hurt. I'm putting my stationery on the floor. Come on. We'll get into my world ..._
>
> _Welcome to **The World Within the Stationery** ... Are you wondering why you're into this cat form? Don't worry: in this world, within what you call stationery paper, your current form is the one of a cat, bacuse it's a  representation of the original intention the stationery artist wanted to give to this world, so you, like me, are subject to such representation. We can say that, unconsciously, these **Rules** are part of a isolated "reality", where we could live. After all, in the mathematical "main" reality, cats can't normally speak._
>
> _You got so cute in that Angora form. Take some moments understanding your form before we continue. By the rules of this world you are subject to be in this form. You could be asking yourself what would happen if we had get into a stationary with dogs drawn into it. Then we should be subject to those representations and rules, but also in a manner that respects our own personality. The Rules don't overcome your personality at all. In my case, probablyI would had taken the shape of a cute little Schnautzer puppy. And about you ... How about a little gracious basset? Not your cup of tea? Well, maybe a Dalmatian, I don't know ..._
>
>  _Anyway, each stationery World partially restricts your power. You see, your power involves the representations of something. Not only by creating them, but by understanding them. That's the most important part of this power and that's this way you will face and fight against **Projections**._
>
> _Why am I showing you all this? The best way to fight the **Projections** is by entering into their past. Dealing with them through the common methods of the logical-mathematical reality, by simply trying to eliminate them in the fastest way, is ineffective: being pushed apart from it, they don't comply with its rules, so those rules don't work against them, although they can use them the when they are convenient. Thus, you need to outsmart them, and use the principle of mathematical logical elimination will not eliminate the problem, which is in fact to discover and remove the **Factors** that led to the **Projection** showing itself. There are methods to solve this, to facilitate the discovery and removal of the projection. They are many ways to do this, and I'll  show you now  of the most effective._
>
> _That is be bringing them into a_ **Stationery World** _and trying to understand what kind of negative feelings materialized and growing to a level that could be converted into such force capable of, by breaking through the reality rules, bringing the **Projection** on. Having done so, you can face them and thus having a chance to rescue the real person engulfed into the Projection, breaking the negative feelings' illusion._
>
> _Yes, it is exactly this, because, in fact, there's no negative feelings: as the name implies,  negative feelings in fact are the absence of a positive feeling: hatred arising by the absence of love, while anger arises by the absence of peace, and so on. If you read about Francis of Assisi, you'll understand a lot this and whi he was one of the most powerful **Among Those Who Deal with Words**._
>
> _How strong the Projections are? Well, the big majority of them are easy to be defeated, but there are some so powerful and evil that existed since the **Time Before History**, being **Stuff of Legends**. And here we have something important: Projections feed on fear, hate, greed and other negative feelings. Many powerful Projections lives since ancient times through the power of myths and legends. Gobelins, Redcaps, Hags... They all exist because their words exists._
>
> _And are against those monsters that you will fight._
>
>  _Let's keep going ... I see you are more comfortable now with the cat form ... You can lick yourself clean if you want, no problem. By walking into this little **Stationery World**, your "natural" form is this one, then there is nothing wrong on it. You are subject to the rules of this reality, and thus the desire to lick yourself in this cat form, as part of this rule, is completely valid._
>
> _You see that creature there? That little green monster? It's probably a someone else's Projection. Let get out to to find what made it ..._
>
> _See that little purse which it's clinging with itself? It must be something he didn't want to give someone else. Probably a toy or candy. Anyway, our goal is to break down this barrier of him and make him let this feeling bad go away, by giving away that. Because otherwise that bad feeling will grow, and the more it grows, the more "real" and powerful the Projection is._
>
> _Come on. We can do this all by choosing the right words._
>
> _And soon you will learn to master the Power of Words._

Our world is logical-mathematical: everything is measured, classified, valued, taxed. Everyone and everything must be measured and classified, and everything not measured or below the ideal should be ignored and even discarded as inefficient or obsolete. Things, objects, values, ideals, people ... Everything and everyone can (and will eventually be) left behind if seen as ineffective or obsolete.

To leave something behind to rot don't make it disappear, however. It'll still be there, somewhere, hidden in the shadows and corners of the minds. Whispering, lurking, voices. Enticing those who were lost or ignored. Those who have lost their value. Those neglected by society.

These people get into desperation, the absence of good feelings leading them to pain, and against that pain they form a Projection to "protect" themselves.

The problem is that they lose control over themselves to the Projection, that takes your body and mind "borrowed" to do harm against others.

You should never, ever, try to attack them with knives, missiles or any other kind of brute force: the Projections don't suffer anything against it. Because they need to "protect" their host, that somehow keeps them in the physical world. And to protect themselves, both physically and mentally, they create an _**Inaction Field**_, which prevents anything to touch the target, because it works on the basis of the total resistance, applying as much resistance as necessary to prevent damage to the thing.

Similarly, the Projections have many kinds of attack modes, from thorns that keeps their targets far away and hurt them, to screams that knocks out their targets by causing panic on those who hear it.

However, there is a small group of people that are able to face the Projections. Chosen from childhood, they can see the harms that brought the Projections and understand their host's pain. Thus, they are capable of curing such pain, making the Project disappear .

Interestingly, their symbol is something simple and old-fashioned:  stationery paper.

This is because many of those stationery have images that for the right eye are not only images, but are symbols of a power that is not quantifiable, and so  was forgotten.

The _**Power of Words**_.

### Aspects

| **Aspect Type**| **Aspect** |
|-|-|
| _High Concept_ | Heir of Magic Words |
| _Trouble_ | Don't Stir up with a Hornet's Nest |
| _Epiphany_| I saw my best friend becoming a **Projection**|
| _Vision_  | There are of those creatures everywhere |
| _Free_ | Lully is a good friend Guardian, but a too much goody two-shoes |

### Approaches

Those in _italics_ are Good ones, those in __bold__ are Bad Ones

| **Approach**| **Level** |
|-|-|
| _Castity_ | Fair (+2) |
| _Charity_ | Fair (+2) |
| _Temperance_ |  Average (+1) |
| _Kindness_ |  Good (+3) | 
| __Envy__ |  Average (+1)| 
| __Wrath__ | Average (+1)|
| _Humility_ | Mediocre (+0)|

### Stunts [ Refresh: 3 ]
+ *__Projection Analyst__*: when you need to Investigate a projection, you receive +2 to _Overcome_ with _Kindness_ for obtaining the Projection's **Factors**
+ *__In your Face:__* +2 to _Create Adavntages_ with _Wrath_ to discover the Projection's **Factors**;
+ *__Martyr Spirit__*: +2 to _Create Advantages_ with _Charity_ to protect others from Projections;

## Projections

Every **Projection** has a number of aspects (called __*Factors*__) that shows what happened to her, and why she became what she is now. To defeat a Projection, the characters must  detect and remove each of the Factors of a Projection. However, Projections are very powerful when Dealing with Words: for each Factor that applies to a situation, they can add +1 in their tests (this is _not_ considered an Aspect Invoke - it's similar the _Three Rocketeers_ system)

A Projection has the same Approaches the PCs have, distributed normally. However, they can't use any Good Approach, and has a Bad Approach for each _Factor_ they have

### Projection Example - The destroyer

#### Factors

+ _Every dog has his day_
+ _I will never cry again_
+ _I didn't ask for all this_
+ _No more humiliations_

#### Approaches

Those in _italics_ are Good ones, those in __bold__ are Bad Ones. As a Projection, the Destroyer can't use any of their _~~Good Approaches~~_.


| **Approach**| **Level** |
|-|-|
| **Lust** | Average (+1) |
| **Avarice** | Fair (+2) |
| _~~Temperance~~_ |  ~~Average (+1)~~ |
| _~~Kindness~~_ |  ~~Fair (+2)~~ | 
| __Envy__ |  Average (+1)| 
| __Wrath__ | Good (+3) |
| _~~Humility~~_ | ~~Mediocre (+0)~~ |

#### Stunts

+ **_Spread the hate_**: +2 to _Create Advantages_ using _Envy_ by creating Aspects representing the things people envy each other;
+ **_Showing the dark side_**: +2 to _Create Advatage_ with _Wrath_ to discover Aspects of a target and show them into a distorted way to everyone else;

The Destroyer is one of the most common and dangerous Projections that can be seen: it reveals itself when a person suffers a lot of humiliation, specially those made gratuitally, as in bullying. In  modern times, it is one of the ones who shows themselves most. Usually it will attack with violence, using his _Wrath_ to hurt their target almost he can. Or perhaps she will try to turn back the pain she suffered by using _Envy_ and _Greed_ to shun or desmorilize their target. 

When a Projection arises, it usually target (at least in theory) the one that caused the most pain and/or those who did "the last straw." 
As an optional rule, the Storyteller can create projections on thugs system Fate Accelerated, the aspects being the same factors. However, she will never stop, and you start to expand their targets to everyone and everything else nearby.

### Turning into a Projection

Every time a character flips one of their Good Approaches to a Bad one (see below, in _Flipping Approaches_), it has a chance to become a _Projection_. Make a _Dilligence/Laziness_ roll against the number of Bad Approaches the character has at the time an Approach is flipped to Bad. If the character fails, it will turn into a _Projection_, receiving a _Factor_ for each Bad Approach it have at the time.

By the way, every time a _Projection_ take out or make someone Concede for him, and at that results a Approach Flipping, the Projection can try to Flip one of the Good Approaches it still have. It does the roll as normal, using the Good Approach it wants to Flip. If it Fails, the Projection grew stronger, by Flipping another Approach and receiving another Factor.

## Reversing Approaches

Reverse an approach normally represents a sudden and painful break into the person's paradigm. Generally only through continuous and systematic suffering a person suffers a Flip from a Good Approach to  a Bad one. Similarly, only many time beside good examples allows an approach to be Flipped from Bad to Good.

Consider that the Good Approaches act as Conditions as in _Fate System Toolkit_, page 18, being they all, for healing effect, _Sticky_. When a character suffers an attack, he can choose to Reverse an Approach, if this make sense at the time, to absorb a number of stress steps equals to the Approach bonus. The GM has the final word on whether the character can or not Flip or a particular Approach, and can make suggestions of Approaches to be Flipped, according to the table below:

| Good approach | Bad approach |
| - | - |
| Charity | Greed |
| Patience | Wrath |
| Temperance | Gluttony |
| Humility | Pride |
| Kindness | Envy |
| Dilligence | Laziness |
| Castity | Lust |

> **Example:** Renato is being constantly bullied at school and is decided that he will no more. When one of the school bullies gives you a very harsh beating, he has to Absorb a 3 steps hits due a punch. Curiously, this is his compassion level, _Good (+3)_. He decides that that was enough and asks the GM if he can Flip his _Patience_ to _Wrath_. The GM decides it's a reasonable explanation for that Flip  the character exploding in anger. Therefore, it absorbs the punch the bully gave and looks at it with bloodshot eyes, revealing there's now only _Wrath_ at his heart, with no more _Patience_

Reversing an Approach from Bad to Goos is a very long and difficult process, although. First of all, the character must observe or be observed by a character with the Good Aapproach to be Flipped Back. Then, the "recovering" character  must make a resisted roll between his Bad Approach against the Good Approach of the character who is watching him. In this case, if the character _fails_, he will start the Good Approach Flipping, it being Flipped Back at the end of the scene. However, he can not do any roll using this Approach during this scen, otherwise he will need to restart the process. Alternatively, the character can:
+ Accept a _success with a high cost_ to still act in spite of the Flipping Back proccess, or;
+ In the case of being involved into a conflict, he can _give away_: in this case, besides the normal benefits of a Giving Away, he may Flip Back his Good Approach;

> **Example:** Renato had done lots of mischief and hurt after Flipping his _Patience_ to _Wrath_. However, his best friend Marina decided to help him back and begins to "treat" him. She has _Patience Fair (+2)_, and spends some time talking with Renato. It soon becomes clear to him that he was being stupid, so he decided to Flip Back his _Wrath_ to _Patience_ . He makes a resisted roll, rolling -2 for a _Average (+1)_ result, while she gets a +0 to a _Fair (+2)_ result. With that, he will "heal" the anger in his heart at the end of this scene. However, the GM decided it will not let the things be that simple: at that time, the bully who made him full of _Wrath_ came back, with a strong urge to beat the crap from Renato. Renato can't use his _Wrath_, or everything Marina did will go down with the flush. So he decides to _concede_: he describes that Renato put himself in front of Marina and tells the bully _"Alright. If you want that so much, go ahead, but do not touch her!"_ He accepts being trashed by the bully (accepting a _Mild Consequence_ in the proccess), while Marina run for the beadle. When she returns, Renato is lying in the ground, his whole body full of bruises and a swollen eye, but with a smile showing that he has now get back his _Patience_ with those who can onle resort into violence for solving their problems.

You can reverse as many Good Approaches you want to absorb Stress, but you can only Flip Back a Bad Approach by scene. However, the Approach  level don't change in the process. So, you can't Flip a Good Approach to absorb stress if it is _Mediocre (+0)_. However, you can Flip Back a Bad Approach that is for some reason Mediocre (+0)(such as being switched with anothe Approach during a _Minor Milestone_), rolling normally. Because of this, as an _optional rule_ the GM can not allow switching levels between two Approaches that are not from the same group, (like switching your _Dilligence_ and _Lust_ ratings) 

### Actions using the Reverse Approach

The Good and Bad Approaches are heads and tails from the same thing: a character with lots of _Wrath_ can also has moments of _Patience_ and vice-versa. So, if for any reason you need to do a roll from one Approach, and the character has the Reverse of the same, the character can in general do the roll, with those caveats:

+ The difficulty grows into +2;
+ The character can't be _Sucessful with a cost_ on this. 

However, he can still uses the Aspects and Fate Points as normal at this roll.

The only exception to this rule is when you whant to Flip Back a character Bad Approach: this can only be done by characters with that Good Approach.

The GM can also define a roll that can be rolled by the two Approaches, like in the Projection roll, that can be done with _Dilligence/Lazyness_. In this case, there's no penalties.

## Projections and Stationary Papers

Projections don't always assume their "real form" in our world. In fact, normally a Projection retains the "normal" form of those who generated him, with maybe something that show the Bad Approaches he haver, like a disheveled hair in the case of _Laziness_, bloodshot eyes in the case of _Wrath_ or a bad-guy smile on case of _Lust_. It's very uncommon that a Projection take its real form in our world. So, the Characters and their Guardians are able to bring the Projection into some kind of writing paper (commonly but not necessarily a Stationery Paper) with a _Create Advatage_ roll of any of their Good Approaches opposed by the most powerful Bad Approach from the Projection (_Teamwork_ bonuses applies). 

Within this _Stationary World_, the character will assume a _Construct Form_, based on thing related with the design and the characteristics of the paper  used (for example, a notebook with Fairies as cover art will make the  characters take a Fairy Form). In this world, Projections will be forced to take their "Real Form": if this don't happen, the target in  is not a Projection, and therefore can't enter this _Stationary World_. The GM will describe the world as he sees it fits, always taking into account the object where the characters "entered".

In terms of rules there are no changes in the tests, but the characters are affected to the elements of this world (being them   treated as Aspects): this explains why it is so dangerous to go into objects that have a more hostile theme (as in a Batman notebook) as they would subject themselves to such rules (not that they have a choice), and so their ability to affect the Projections could  fall, while the Projections influence against  the characters could rise.

This "world" can be attacked by the Projections normally. Consider that they have a normal stress track of three boxes and two Conditions: _Damaged (1)_ and _Useless (4)_. The problem is that the conditions in question are NOT RECOVERABLE. And worse, the "world" has no way to defend itself: the characters must protect it. If the world is Defeated, the Projection will be free and can add a new Factor as Aspect, by Flipping another of the victim's Approaches. And the characters are "ejected" from the Defeated (normally Destroyed) Stationary Paper, being Disoriented (as a Mild Consequence) and will have to start the whole process again.

An option to "defeat" of a Projection is a Knockout: if the Projection surrender or is Defeated in a purely physical conflict, the Projection will retreat, "freeing" temporarily his victim, but still whispering in his mind: as soon as an Aspect of him is forced (including the Projection's Factors), the projection take the control back. The only way to Defeat a Projection for good is to discover and remove (via _Create Advantages_ and _Overcome_ actions) its Factors, one by one. Just by Defeat a Projection the PCs can get out a _Stationary World_ normally.

The _Stationary World_ **Rules** are considered as Scenario Aspects while the characters are inside of it. Eache World has several Rules: the GM can set as many as he want, at least one. Any change that a Rule could apply not imply into personality changes of thos involved. Curiously, the Projections are immune to the shapeshifting effects that some rules can do. We advise something between 1 to 3 Aspects as Rules. Rules can be known by normal _Create Advantages_ rolls with suitable Approaches.
