The client is an old time druid that is responsible for a Fertility ritual where two lovers would find their way into a sacred glen and, after defeating evil forces, would marry at the glen... However, there's no more glens like that near, so they need the favors of those people. And, to turn things worst, the chosen pair are from rich families that don't want they to be hurt!

+ Approaches (Lovers): Flashy, Clever. 
+ Requirements (Druid): Lots of Forest Creatures!, "Sacred" Glen, some evil foes to be defeated, (Families) Just keep things safe!
+ Hidden Aspects (Lovers): POWER OF LOVE!, No one mess with my other half!, I can bring that on!, Sing like a Princess!
+ Turn offs: (Lovers) Too much Gore, Bad Language! (Druid) No abominations (Families) Don't hurt them!
+ Tour Twists: Bring some of my friends!, The Pixies are not being colaborative!, Some orcs wants the glen as their house, A Donkey Head should fits the groom well.

## Part 1 - The Setup

The PCs are contacted by the local Druid and old-time acquaintance of them. He came to the party, somewhere in the limits of the local woods and says:

> _"I'm Sarek, a Druid, and we are into a big of a trouble._
> 
> _Every year, there's a need for a fertility ritual during Spring Equinox, where two lovers are sent into a glen from oposite sides, and they have to get into the middle of it by their own forces. If they can do this, they, and our village by extension, are blessed with great crops and growing._
> 
> _When those are with more commoner people, it would be okay to just do this as always. However, this year the lottery gave the Lord Marcer and Lady Anders' sons, and they were vere strict on that_ "We don't want our pumpkins to be killed" _thing. Not that any couple were killed during the ritual, but you know how are those pesky lords..._
>
> _And this is where you came... I think you heard about the __dungeoneering__, that lordly infatuation some nobles does those days, about getting into a dungeon with some adventurers. I know that some of then even make some fake dungeons, that could be good enoug for those lords. I think you can do something like this. Just build some threat scary enough for them to put their head seriously into the ritual, but not seriously enough for them to be hurt._
>
> _Please, this ritual is something very important. The deities would not be happy and the crops would be bad if this was not executed. But those lords would never accept this if there was any danger risk for their sons. Obviously, you'll be paid for the trouble."_

He need that the ritual can go straight enough to please the Nature deities, but safe enough to not see himself under Lord Marcer and Lady Andens' crossfire.

#### Requirements & Pet Peeves 

Sarek will be clean on the need of creatures from nature forces (Elves, Pixies, Sprites and so), the avoidance on Abominations, and about the use of nature elements on the "Dungeon" (Sun, Flowers, even things like thorns), otherwise the PCs are free on how to design the Dungeon

## Part 1a - Talking with the Lovers (and their Parents)

As part of the ritual, Lord Marcer and Lady Anders had isolated their sons, Lord Matthäus Marcer and Lady Haland Anders.

If they talk with the two ___Chosen Lovers___ (as they are called during the ritual), that are in separate towers under the Temple of the God of Peace, Zitz, purifying themselves under the ritual specifications (like dressing only in white and take frequents baths and fastenings), the PCs will discover that they are in fact ___True Lovers, as True as True can be!___ (yup, that's a Disney trope here), but their families despise each other, and a ___marriage between them, to their parents, are just a way to grow into power and influence___. They believe that ___They had being their name lottered was Fate's work___ and ___they don't have no fear (and probably Common Sense)___ to get thorugh the ritual, as is known that ___Only True Lovers can get through the Ritual (or so says the Legends)____.

### Lord Matthäus Marcer

| __Type__ | __Aspect__ | 
|---------:|---|
| _High Concept_ | Human Lord, Heir of House Marcer |

| ___Hidden Talent___ | I do my chores always, that can be useful; The Voice of a Princess (as in Disney); I know all the old stories and their riddles! |

Now that they talked with the Lovers, maybe they'll try to talk with Lord Kristas Marcer and Lady Maressa Anders, the Couple's Parents. They are very reticent on the ritual, only allowed them because this could put their families against the populace, and that would not be good. However, they don't think that Mätthäus and Haland are in love for real (spoiler: they are), thinking this is just ___Infatuation from a Kid___ (spoiler: it's not).

### Lord Kristas Marcer and Lady Maressa Anders

___Powerful Lords; Despise each other and the other's fmaily; Gave birth to kittens when their sons are in danger!___

|-------------|--|
| ___Pet Peeves___  | _"Don't touch my son!"_ (for both of them) |

### Part 1b - The Legend

The legend is clear as water, but the PCs can spice it as they want, as long as include the core of the legend (the idea about the Lovers get throught the glen until they arrive at their middle and this being done by their own forces. Otherwise, they can even ask Sarek about themes they can use it.

### Part 1c - The Location

There's some ___Sacred Glens___ that the PCs can use to mount their "dungeon". However, the ___Nature Spirits are a little pesky and mischievous___, although not mean. They can ask some of the local leaders of the ___Nature Spirits___ for help (maybe under some money)

Some landlords:

#### Melador, Leader of the Nature Spirits

| _Sneaky_     | Fair (+2)    |

##### Properties

Trees, rivers, forest

### Part 1d - The Battle Plan

When designing the Dungeon, there's a thing the PCs need to put into mind: they'll need to split the "rooms" and Threat, as they'll need to consider on that ___the Lovers will enter at the glen by opposite sides___! This is very important to be put under account. This also should be put into accord in the remaining of the session, either in the Build (trying to split correctly Fake and Real Threats) and during the Tour (by splitting accordingly the PCs as chaperones and guides)

### Part 3 - The Tour

The Part 2 will occur as by the Dungeon Tours LTD book.

The Part 3 will get also normally, but with some twist.

1. First of all, the "escalation" in the Impression Check goes "linear", considering ALL the rooms, from both sides (Lord Marten and Lady Anders'), and;
2. There is not only one, but TWO Cynics:
   a. _Lord Matthäus' sister_, Lady Marya, that is a ___Druidess-in-training___ and has some ___grudges with Sarek___, because she thinks that ___rituals should go as by the book___. She thinks that Sarek could concede into their sacred duties based on his parent power, but she would not raise a hand for Sarek into a grudge between his family and Sarek, as she also wants to grow into druidic structure, and;
   b. _Lady Haland's brother_, Lord Sandern, that is ___Corporal for the Kingdom's Army___. He see her sister as a ___good-for-nothing girl___ and has some grudge against her, as ___he wants the power into Anders House___ and thinks that ___Might makes Right___;

#### Lady Marya Marten

##### Aspects 

| __Type__ | __Aspect__ | 
|---------:|---|
| _High Concept_ | Human Druidess-in-training |
| | Rituals should go by the book |
| | _"Looks like Sarek is not doing his job... I think I can profit on this!"_ |

##### Approaches

| __Approach__ | __Level__    | 
|-------------:|--------------|
| _Careful_    | Fair (+2)    |
| _Clever_     | Good (+3)    |
| _Flashy_     | Mediocre (+0)|
| _Forceful_   | Average (+1) |
| _Quick_      | Average (+1) |
| _Sneaky_     | Fair (+2)    |

##### Possible Twist

Marya is a potential source for the _3rd Wheel_, _Threat of Exposure_ or by inducing _Dead Air_ to prejudice the things.

To be fair, Marya has no problem if things just go smooth in this ritual, but if she sees some REAL problem or evidence on ritual cheating, she will go all out to say on how the ritual is being spoiled. Otherwise, she'll just go by as a second observer and just warrant everything will go okay. She'll have nothing if things looks a little easier for his brother.

#### Lady Sandern Anders

##### Aspects 

| __Type__ | __Aspect__ | 
|---------:|---|
| _High Concept_ | Human Corporal from the kingdom |
| | Might makes Right |
| | Anders House is my only care |
| | Disgust agains non-human creatures |

##### Approaches

| __Approach__ | __Level__    | 
|-------------:|--------------|
| _Careful_    | Fair (+2)    |
| _Clever_     | Average (+1) |
| _Flashy_     | Fair (+2)    |
| _Forceful_   | Good (+3)    |
| _Quick_      | Average (+1) |
| _Sneaky_     | Mediocre (+0)|

##### Possible Twist

He's a potential _Where Did 'e Go_ or _Dose of Realism_, by bringing some threats by himself

Although he's not the brightest apple, he's not a door also, and if he have any suspect that the ritual was faked, he'll use this to put the PCs into a ploy and by this kill Haland and use the PCs as a scapegoat. He'll try to find any threats that can be used to force an assassination. He can even brought their own Threats, all of them considered Real. Consider that as a new Real Threat brought by him, using the same rules, but a Victory here would not provide bonus on the final Impression Check
