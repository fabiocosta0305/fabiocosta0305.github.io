## Request for Aid

The Company is at a  _Caravansarai_, a kind of inn and meeting point for Caravans that crosses the ___Desert___ through the commercial routes of ___Gold and Silk Road___, where they hear stories about the dilemma of _Faithful Henry_ (or _Iron Henry_), but by the his real name, _Hassam_ (in the West he assumed the name Henry when served as steward for some dukes) all around. When (and if) they asks the caravan-men, they will tell the story of how the Sultan Al-Hashid was turned into a frog by a wicked desert wizard and sent to a land far away by a terrible vulture. But recently, _Faithful Hassam_ discovered that his master was released from his curse in a distant land and brought him back, with the foreigner princess who freed him.

Recently, however, _Faithful Hassam_ had grown sully again, and it's said that this is due the fact that his heart was again put into Steel Bands, which he asked to be placed by one of the _Jann_ of the desert, so his heart would not burst with sorrow and desolation.

Some say this was because he fell in love with the criminal known as _The Desert Lady-Thief_. She had her head put under a price by the Sultan Vizier, Hamad, as a thief and murderer after several caravans were alleged attacked by her.

If they look for Hassam, he will tell his story and show his chest: everyone can see three stripes at the chest where his heart is: very likely those stripes are the three steel bands that the _Jann_ placed to hold his heart whole. He appears to be cold, but certainly this is due of the steel bands.

> _"I have always been faithful to my master, but he does not listen to me on this case! I don't believe she is a murderer as they say! I just didn't left my station as my Sultan's steward for the loyalty I have to him... But I had bound my heart again by steel bands to not burst in sorrow! What had I done to the Gods to deserve such unhappiness?"_ he says

> + ___Problem:___ _Faithful Hassam_ is torn between happiness and duty, because his other half was branded as a thief and murderer  by the Sultan;
> + ___Solution:___ Discover the truth behind all this and try to convince the Sultan to lift the death penalty, so they two could have their Happy Ending

<!-- excerpt -->

## Investigation

If they look for the Sultan, Hassam himself will have a time to talk with it, being him from a very important station among the servants of the Sultan as a Steward. The Sultan will talk with the Company and explain that the Vizier Hamad has found that the Lady-Thief wants to overthrow the order in the Kingdom and upraise a revolution among the people to seize his power. The Sultan himself will say that they have no evidence, but the Vizier Hamad is a wise man who was Vizier and Counselor since before his Father.

The Vizier will speak very little, only claim that the _Lady-Thief_ co-opted Hassam by arts of seduction, and that she's making him go against where his loyalties should really be. One curious thing the Company will see is that the Vizier uses a __Ring of Power__ where a Genie is held captive. In the case, a powerful _Ifrit_, a Fire Spirit, powerful and dangerous, but restrained and contained by the magical  arts and spells laced into the Ring.

On the other hand, if the characters go into talk with the people in Cafes, Inns and Markets, they will see that they love Sultan Al-Hashid as much as Hassam and Fatima, the real name of the Lady-Thief. Everyone believes that the kingdom will be much better if Fatima and Hassam got married and in stations of power, and everyone knows about the self-imposed punishment that Hassam has put up on himself in the two times. Curiously, the Vizier is hated, although people do not speak it clearly because of the ___spies and guards___ he had spread all around. They call him ___Hasad Hamad___ (___Jealous Hamad___) , and they know that the Vizier has always tried to seize the power and be the Sultan, although he always get away with this because he did this undercover. During the period when the _Janni_ cursed Hashid (or so people thinks), he was _Lord of the Sultanate_, and it was when Fatima turned into _The Lady-Thief_.

The people is not sure that the _Janni_ actually had cursed Hashid: he was raised in the Ancient Wisdom, and had some of the best preceptors and _Suffis_ as teachers, so he was (or would) be educated into the traditions of the Desert People. Even the _Tuaregs_  was respected: they will confirm that it would impossible for Hashid to violate the ___Laws of Hospitality___ or acting against _Janni_ or any other thing that would be enough to put him into a so great curse.

The people will also say that Hamad is a powerful magician, and acquainted into the mystical traditions of the _Suffi_, so he is sire of many powers. Although he does not know the magic needed to transfigurate a person's form (or so they thinks), he knows lots of magic, and every time the _Tuaregs_ attempted something against the Sultanate, they had gone under big defeats under his hands. The only person who apparently can fight against the Vizier is _The Lady-Thief_.

It is also a known fact that the Vizier has cached lots of political power, especially around the Bedouins of the Oasis: many of their most influential leaders owe favors to the Vizier, who has helped them with certain charms and sortilegies against the worst animals of the Desert and some of the most dangerous _Janni_. This may be a great problem, as this put the people of the Sultanate on a dangerous collision route against the Desert _Janni_, and the _Janni_ hates to be put under submission, even more into their own territory.

Most likely they will ask where _The Lady-thief_ hides herself, and everyone will say that she can be found somewhere in the Desert. The Company probably will need to haggle for supplies to survive in the fierce Desert, specially the precious water. Always remember them that the place is warm by day and cold at night: proper clothes and water are almost as precious as gold in the Desert, if not more.

## The Desert

The Company can get into the _In-Between_ easily as it basically surrounds the kingdom and go as far as the horizon, here and there punctuated with the life-saving Oasis, places of abundance in the middle of the desolation of the desert, that the caravaners uses as route for ___Gold and Silk road___, where caravans goes with trading goods from the East to the West and vice versa, resting into the Oasis and the _Caravansarai_, large walled inns that provides caravans safety against the dangers of the desert and all kinds facilities, both of physical, like water wells and supplies' vendors, and of spiritual level.

Here they will look for the _Lady-Thief's Gang_ and see how much of the Vizier story is truth (and the truth behind what is not). Snakes, Scorpions and other animals can be seen occasionally, as can be the eagles and vultures that prey on them, and other animals such as hedgehogs and desert rats that feed on the few flowers and trees that can be seen in the desert. Snags will appear to provide players with challenges and clues about the whole thing.

### Monsters

Poisonous snakes and scorpions can be found all around: they are insidious creatures with powerful venoms that they use very well. They receive +2 to attack with their fangs or stings. If a PC is hit, treat this also as a Challenge between the Poison's ___Power___ (from _Fair (+2)_ to _Great (+4)_, GM's discretion) against the PC's Physique, albeit the damage normally provoked, the PC suffering a ___Poisoned___ Aspect.

Eagles and Vultures usually attack from the air, with +2 when attacking flying, while Hyenas attacks as a pack with +2, but at -2 when attacking alone

Leopards attack during the day, catching surprised characters. They hide in small brushes of parched trees, receiving +2 to hide and attack surprised targets. Because they are impulsive, they receive -2 by defending themselves after attacking quickly.

Small rodents and predators, such as meerkats, skunks and rats are dangerous at night, at least when provoked. When attacking, they attack in packs, with +2 when attacking in pack. On the other hand, they are usually weak when solitary, receiving -2 when defending themselves when attacked individually.

Finally, hedgehogs and porcupines are normally peaceful, only attacking with the large prickles they have when provoked. Normally, they get +2 for the prickles, and -2 when they attempt to attack intentionally.

### Hazards

The ___Sand Storms___ are really dangerous: treat as a Challenge between the Athletics of the PC against a _Good (+3)_ __Risk__, for each PC: if at least one of the characters wins the Challenge, they will be able to resist the Sandstorm, but those who was defeated should absorb a 3-stress Attack, or temporarily  goes ___Blind___ (an Aspect that can be treated as a _Mild Consequence_). A Resource check against the Consequence level will be enough for the PCs to remove the Blindness (as this was provoked by the sand in their eyes), but a Fail can cause them to lose some of the precious water they still have. Lore can also be useful into some of those checks, but a Failure turned into a Success with a Cost  can cause a Moderate Consequence _Spoilt Provisions_

The ___Extreme Climate___ in the desert are also a problem: a character who fails in _Lore_ Checks may ___not prepare himself properly___ (use this as a Secret Aspect to be Compelled against the PCs). The weather is very hot during the day but during the nights are almost as dangerous as into the day due to the inclement cold. A Failure in _Knowledge_ may also indicate that they have not purchased adequate supplies, which may either spoil or sour, and may render them sick if they consume those ___Spoilt Provisions___.

The ___Fake Caravan___ is something that provides the characters a way to unveil part of the plot: a group of _Corrupted Bedouins_  is under the Vizier's pockets. The characters will discover that they are actually pretending they are being stolen, the goods "lost" going  to the Vizier's personal caches located in the Desert and guarded by a series of terrible ___Ali Baba-liked___ Challenges.

A really serious problem for those who don't understand how things works in the Desert are the ___Laws of Hospitality___. Abusing or neglecting the surrounding communities is something in the Desert as lethal as Naja's poison. If, at any time, the characters go against the ___Laws of Hospitality___, they will receive an appropriate Appearance that they cannot Invoke. They'll need a really serious Test of Kindness for the PCs worthy of consideration under the ___Laws___. Unworthy characters will not normally be received well in the Oasis and will not even have access to its resources, including the always precious water. Furthermore, any Bedouin who is unscrupulous enough to deal with Unworthy people will actually extort the characters. While under an Unworthy Aspect, the difficulty of all Resources checks for trading in the Desert increases by +2.

Finally, there's groups of ___Tuaregs___ that usually attack unsuspecting characters (Fair (+2) _Notice_ checks). They are ferocious and quick to attack, but they are cowards: if the characters defeat at least half of them, they will flee desperately, using sand powder to avoid being persecuted ... But if the characters want to chase them, give them the chance of finding some treasures and goods into their lairs in the Desert into the best ___Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves___ style.

### Population

The Desert is the path of huge caravans of ___Traders and Bedouins___, crossing the ___Gold and Silk Road___ that passes off the Sultanate through the Desert, and sometimes inhabits the Oasis, and also is home to the famous mystical sages _Suffis_, that hide in caves and lairs around the desert, where they can practice their mystical arts in peace and solitude. Also this is home of the powerful and dangerous _Janni_ who live among the elements of the desert, as well of the _Tuaregs_, dangerous robbers and bandits of the desert, looking for the largest dunes and some clusters of rocks where they can hide.

+ ___Tuaregs___ are ___Fierce, Superstitious___ and ___Treacherous___. They're torn into using their strength as _Mercenaries_, protecting the caravans that cross the Desert from one side to the other of the World, or as _Robbers_, stealing the precious goods that  crosses the ___Gold and Silk Road___. All _Tuaregs_ have at least _Good (+3) Fight_;
+ ___Bedouins and Merchants___ are ___Touchy, Hospitable___ and ___Traditionalists___. They are torn between stay crossing the Desert _trading_ exotic products on one side or the other of the ___Gold and Silk Road___, or content themselves with _shepherding_ the precious sheep and goats in the Oasis. They all have _Good (+3) Rapport_;
+ The ___Suffis___ are ___Mystics, Wise___ and ___Stubborn___, feeling torn between living a _monastic_ life, keeping their knowledge only for themselves or offering their wisdom as _Sages_ to those interested in the Desert and in the Sultanate. The all have at least _Good (+3) Lore_ 
+ And the powerful ___Jannis___ are ___Magical, Reluctant___ and ___Respectable___, torn between the idea of ​​_Partnering_ with local peoples, offering their magic and wisdom to help them, or _Ruling_ them, using their magic to put the  obviously weaker mortals under their will. All of them have at least _Exceptional (+5) Magic (Any type, normally Great)_ 

### Secret

The Desert _Janni_ have been hunted by evil Magician and Suffis by long for their powers. Those who are captured are under the will of their holder. The Magic to imprison a _Jann_ is complex, but many _Suffis_ knows how to do this. One reason the Vizier is doing   everything to kill the _Lady-thief_ is to make Hassam's heart to explode into sorrow and unhappiness, literally: he believes that by doing this, he will get the alchemical materials to alchemical transmute a powerful amulet to contain the _King of the Desert_ Janni

### Snags

+ ___The Old woman in the Desert:___ The characters can find an old woman lost in the desert, dangerous thirsty. If the characters share their water ration (they accept to suffer 1 Physical Stress due to lack of water, as a Vitality Sacrifice), she'll ___bless___ the characters. Otherwise, she'll curse them for violating the ___Laws of Hospitality___ of _"Thou shall not left the needy behind"_.
+ ___Resgating the Ram:___ the characters will see a lost ram in the middle of some rocks, ready to be attacked by some snakes. The little His shepherd will help the PCs with clues about the peoples in the Desert and so if they rescue the ram, but otherwise he could be a hindrance to them, if they look for some Oasis to rest and gather information.
+ ___Challenging the Djinn:___ Daruich, a desert-free _Djinn_, decides to boldly challenge ___"the most powerful of the powerful"___. The Challenge will depend on who will accept it, but the important thing here not whether they will be succeeded or not, but if they are able  of providing him an interesting challenge and if they can deal into civil ways with victory or defeat. If they pass through this Test, it will offer information, a Wish, and/or a rare phoenix feather, an item they can use for almost every type of resolution of Impossible Problems, to the characters. However, if he's defeated and the PC don't are civil with him, they'll put them into powerful curses, including transformations, branding as Unworthy and so on.

## The Lady-Thief

The Lady-Thief Fatima Hakim Samara _bint_ Mudiya _ibn_ Rashid (___Fatima Samara, the Wise Daughter of the Enlightened One, son of the Just One___), was raised as a princess by his Father, one of the oldest Suffis sages of the Desert. Nicknamed _Tarik Amina_ (___Princess of the Dates___, for her beauty), she was raised up to be a Princess, until she was 12-year-old. However, when the Vizier cursed Prince Hashid and turned him into become a frog, she took her weapons and raised her Suffi court against the Vizier.

When the prince returned with a foreign princess, she felt some jealousy, but as Henry (or Hassam, as she knew him) became part of the court, she fell in love with him, and he with her. At the same time she accepted the fact that she could be a counselor and still follow her destiny to provide Hashid good counsels.

But it was when the Vizier interfered and said that she was a thief that stole from the caravans that came from both the West and the East. The truth is that she knows that the Vizier is Corrupted and is in secret the Desert _Tuaregs_ leader.

The Vizier put Fatima's head under a prize and then she had to hide herself in the desert, using her knowledge as Suffi to survive. As she was charged with a crime (although she was innocent), she can't get into the Oasis, since the ___Laws of Hospitality___ doesn't apply against criminals.

The Company can help Fatima by cleanse her name in front of the Sultan. This can cost them a Curse (having the Vizier as an enemy), or giving up the Heart Desire (killing the Vizier will free the _Ifrit_ that is imprisoned by the same that can be grateful to the Company for this). Another way can be an Impossible Task imposed by Vizier, or characters may have to work together with _Suffi_ or _Janni_. Going against them can cost them a Curse or a Promise.
