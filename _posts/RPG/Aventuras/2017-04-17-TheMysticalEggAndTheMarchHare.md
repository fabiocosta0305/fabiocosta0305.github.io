## Scene 1 - The Rabbitman

New York, March 1911. Easter is comming, and the children of ___Madam Sheridan’s orphan’s house and boarding school___ are excited with the Chocolate Egg Hunt that is sponsored and organized by the good men and women of _The Century Club_, to bring a little happiness and hope for the youth and poor in the Clinton Neighborhood.

As a plus, new sweets are launched every year. This year the new wave is the _March Hare Chocolate Eggs_, which, albeit cheap, is delicious. In fact, many can't stop eating this.

However, one news shocked the city: ___one of the rare Faberge Eggs ___, made by the Fabergé Family, goldsmiths that works for the Russian Tsars, ___ was recently stolen ___ when put at display at the Smithsorian Museum! No one knows who stole it, even more considering the intense vigilance which the Egg was under! The New York Police are baffled, even more that ___all clues points to something that is not human___!

<! - excerpt ->

Also, when the Young Centurions go to the _Century Club_ in New York, they see a little man dressed in bizarre clothes that is asking the _Club_ for help. This little man is none other than Mr. ___Willy Wonka___, ___one of the biggest_ Chocolatiere _of the world___, and he has had his ___Wonka Sweets Recipe Book___ stolen, with all the secrets on how he makes the ___most delicious sweets ever imagined___!

He will say that a strange half-man, half-rabbit creature stole his Recipe book, but he lost track of it in New York. He is now under a extreme paranoia, thinking that this creature had stolen his cookbook to sell it to his competitors by the biggest bid, but he doesn't know what is happeing, and neither why the robber would use that weird costume while doing the larceny!

And more: if the characters read the newspapers or going through contacts in the _East Side_, they will discover that a half-man, half-rabbit creature was spotted near the Docks or somewhere near _Central Park_. No one had seen it enough, but enough to make people worried!

### Issues

+ A very tasteful new Chocolate Egg is ready for Easter
+ Mr. Wonka searches for the Century Club: he was robbed from his Chocolate Egg recipe!
+ A very rare Farbegé Egg was stealed from the Smithsorian Museum
+ Who is the weird Rabbitman that is seeing around NY?

## Scene 2 - I can't stop eating

In spite of everything, the sale of the _March Hare Chocolate Eggs_ goes a long way, being the last wave: they are ___so tasty that people can't stop eating them___.

As the days go by, however, more and more Rabbit-Man sightings are reported: specially seen during the night, they have been done heists, form money and stuff especially Chocolate. Curiously enough, this only makes the sale of the _March Hare Chocolate Eggs_ continue in the stern, as curiously they are not stolen.

At this moment, another man searches the _Club_ for help about something that was stolen: Agathon Fabergé, one of the House Fabergé's golsmiths, will mention about the stolen Fabergé Egg and about another Egg, rarer and unknown (or so he thinks) outside Russia , The _Secret Fabergé_, that he was ordered to get back to the Tsar, or destroy if this would not be possible.

He will say the magical powers of the _Secret Fabergé_, especially the Shapeshifting one, and they will see a _March Hare Chocolate Egg_ open, one of the Mentors (or other Adult Spirit or Sponsor) shoving the Egg into his mouth as there would be no tomorrow and becoming more and more obsessed with the Egg... 

Not to mention the little whiskers growing out of the side of his nose!

+ The March Hare Chocolate Eggs is selling like hotcackes!
+ Some Rabbitman is seeing commiting crimes and stealing money and other things
+ Agathon Fabergé talks with the Century Club
+ A Young Centurions' mentor eat the Chocolate Egg!

## Scene 3 - The Rabbitmen Army

A few days after, people are terrified with the raise of robberies and spottings of the strange Rabbitmen. At the same time, people stays buying and eating _March Hare Chocolate Eggs_ as if there were no tomorrow, so much that starts a shortage on the Eggs  people start to fight each other by the Eggs.

Characters who gone under _Fair (+2)_ checks (by _Careful_ by defaul) will notice that all those who started to fight for the eggs have bizarre but similar characteristics: hands with white shaggy fur at their backs, incisor teeth larger than normal, cleft lips with slightly raised noses, afluffy residual hair (fur?), albino eyes with huge pupils, and longer elongated ears! An _Great (+4)_ check will show a link between the _March Hare Chocolate Eggs_ eating  and those mutations.

If they do not notice this by walking through the city, they will see that their mentor, after shoving March Hare Chocolate Egg after Chocolate Egg looks more and more like a Rabbit. Not to mention that he wants so much to get out and go to the _East Side_ Docks, even without knowing why.

It will be up to the characters to investigate what is happening. To do this, they will need to go to _East Side_ to see if they find any clue on why the _March Hare Chocolate Egg_ is turning people into Rabbitmen and how to reverse the mutation!

+ Lots of Rabbitman are seeing going to the East Side Docks
+ People are scared, but many are eating March Hare Chocolate Eggs like there was no tomorrow!
+ March Hare Chocolate Eggs are turning people in Rabbitman!
+ The Mentor is now almost a Rabbitman!

## Scene 4 - The Rabbitmen Rises

As people goes more and more to one of the _East Side_ Warehouse, the characters will realize that the Rabbitmen ___don't worry about being followed, but about being blocked from going to East Side___: any attempt to stop them will result in several of them grouping to fight the characters, and the last thing the characters will want now (we hope so) is to deal with a mob of rabid Rabbitmen.

As they arrive in the warehouse (apparently ___the Rabbitmen know where to go by the smell___), they will see several people already turned into Rabbitmen, or at various transformation level. They are working in the Warehouse, that where turned into a candy shop, and they are working, and eating, something that everyone in New York is fiercing fight for: the _March Hare Chocolate Egg_.

In a balcony above the floor, the characters will see a strange creature: with the height of a small man, putting aside the light brown elongated ears, with a rabbit muzzle where his upper lip and nose should be, a big pair of incisor teeth showing over. Despite his size, his  hands, or rather paws, are agile and, although they are finished in four fingers with retractable claws, they are quite skillful. His legs are now the legs of a rabbit, and he "sits" on his haunches, now thick and powerful as one of a rabbit's.

The clothes of the weird half-man half-rabbit (or half-hare, to be exact), resembles __Alice in Wonderland'_s March Hare___: cuff in an orange tone like those of his fur, white shirt and blue bow tie. He also wears cream colored trousers and a pair of leggings on her legs.

He is holding an egg-shaped jewel, a crystal with the sides with gold details, a golden top and a support in the same material. He is pointing the same to a large copper casserole, where the PCs can see chocolate being continuously melted and stirred, its contents poured into pots, where it's mixed with other ingredients such as cocoa, sugar, spice, essences, nuts and stuff.

The ___chocolate smell is overwhelming___, and anyone who had eaten the _March Hare Chocolate Egg_ will feel an obsessive need to eat the Eggs until burst (_Superb (+5) _ rolls to resist the temptation). All the "workers" are rabbitmen, and they basically wrap an egg and eat the next: all of them are already in a ___ not quite human shape___.

When confronted, the _March Hare_ will gloat his history and how, according to him, _"the future is of the_ Oryctolagus Sapiens, _or, to put simply, the rabbit-men."_ He will then tell about the _Secret Fabergé_ and about how he thought on irradiating its energies in the chocolate, which he produces by using a recipe from the ___Wonka Sweets Recipe Book___. The combination of the perfect chocolate recipe and the _Secret Fabergé_'s mystical energies resulted in a chocolate that is irresistible, and that turns those who eats it rabbitmen like the _March Hare_.

A Conflict here would be a big mess for several reasons:

1. The Rabbitmen are so addicted to the Eggs that they will do everything to protect (or eat) them, including ___fighting the PCs and other somewhat suicidal actions___
2. Some of the more "advanced" Rabbitmen now ___obeys the March Hare 100%___ without questioning the orders or their consequences
3. They'll need the _Secrer Fabergé_ to figure out how to undo the rabbitman transformation and bring everyone back to normal.

However, some of the ingredients that are flammable, like Whiskey and Irish _Brandy_: the PCs can use them to create some distraction that, done rightly, might be the best way to make the transformed Rabbitmen run away or at least not help the _March Hare_: They, like the Rabbits who they are partly, have a ___Strong Flight Instinct, triggerd by almost anything___. If the PCs uses fire as weapon against them or set fire to anything in the warehose, do a ___Fantastic (+6)___ check for the Rabbitmen: in case of Failure (most likely), they will ___Run for their lives___, Like a mob.

The _March Hare_, however, will not suffer from this: he is smarter and can already (at least partially) contain this rabbity Flight instinct. And more, he's megalomaniacal and selfish: ___in his mind, things are under his control___.

However, if the PCs were clever enough, they may freeze him,  by staring intensely him: if at any time, the PCs have a _Success with Style_ against the _March Hare_, give them the option to put a _Gazed_ Boost on the  _March Hare_

+ The Rabbitmen are working into making March Hare Chocolate Eggs for the March Hare!
+ He is rising an army to invade NYC!
+ The Centurions needs to stop the March Hare and discover how to (at least) break the March Hare's control and (if possible) turn people back!

## Epilogue

We hope the characters successfully arrests the _March Hare_, and returns  _Secret Fabergé_ and the _Wonka Sweet Recipe Book_ to their owners. Once the  _Secret Fabergé_ is took from the _March Hare_, his power overt the other rabbitsmen will be over.

However, there is still much to be solved:

1. People turned into Rabbitmen will remain in this form: some may wish to remain into it for a range of reasons. How to deal with this new situation? Is't possible for them to become normal people again?
2. The _Secret Fabergé_ is a very rare and powerful magical item, and the Tsar desires it back desperately to refrain his political enemies. How will the _Century Club_ deal with this? Maybe the _Club_ will retain the _Secret Fabergé_ with them, at least long enough to study its properties
3. The _March Hare_ can't be put into a "common" jail, much less taken to the _Century Club_ chapter: there are so many powerful mystical items there that could be used for an escape by this deluded, but smart, man... How to deal with this weird prisioner?
4. Amidst the confusing notes of the March Here, some parts seemed strangely mathematical... Would it be this a clue on the involvement of other Shadows behind the actions of the Hare?

This adventure is treated as a _Minor Milestone_.

## NPCs

### Agathon Fabergé, Mystic Jeweler

For everyone else, the House of Fabergé is known as goldsmiths and jewelers, and they are known mainly because of the gorgeous _Fabergé eggs_, gave by the Tzars for ther mothers and wives each and every easter.

However, very few people outside Russia knows one of the most secret facets of Farbegé: they are mystics.

Working for the Tzars since their foundation, the House of Fabergé have the secret mission of creating some magical artifacts they could use for the Russian Crown interests. Simple things, like lies and poison detectors. They did this by hiding those powers under special sigils engraved in the famous Fabergé Eggs.

However, in the turning of the Century, the Tzar asked for a special Egg, one with more powerful enchantments, using the power of Mother Russia and Baba Yaga to enforce the Tzar will and doing all kind of magics, big and small.

As a security measure, the ___Secret Farbegé Egg___ would be a ___otherwise  "Common" Fabergé Egg___, but ___his real powers would be revealed and used when he was specially illuminated___ using candles and so.

One of the most terrible power was the ___Shapeshifting___ power: by opening a secret compartment and putting on it something that represents the final form of the subject after the magic done, the Secret Egg could ___turn people into other forms, either totally or partially___, depending on how much time and how much of the something was in the compartment. The Tzar himself turned many of his enemies into donkeys, dogs, cats or goats, and even in half-animal freaks for exhibition in the Moscow Circus.

The Secret Farbegé was rumored since he was built, but he was safely held by the Russian Secret Police and so.

Until two years ago.

A crazy looney, called The March Hare, invaded and robbed the Secret Farbegé, during one of its rare exhibitions. He dressed as _Alice in Wonderland_'s March Hare and no one knew how and why he passed by all the guards and abducted so powerful magic item.

The Tzar gave a mission for the Fabergé: to acquire back the Egg, or to destroy it. 

And Agathon Fabergé was the one incubed to take back the Egg.

He was now hunting the Hare like a Dog (no pun indeed), and discovered that the delusional men now is a half-man, half-rabbit freak and discovered how to enchant people and turn them into rabbitman under his will.

And Agathon could not allow this to go on.

### The March Hare, Crazy Rabbitman and Negative

Marshall "March" Hare was always someone crazy as a nut, or so people though.

But, as someone born in December 31st, 1879, he was obsessed with something. After all, he was a _Negative_

In fact, very soon he was obssessively attached with Rabbits, Hares and so on. After reading Lewis Carrol's _Alice in Wonderland_, he deluded himself as an inhabitant of Wonderland. In fact, he though he was the March Hare, as people called him "mad as a March Hare".

Using _Alice in Wonderland_ as a role model, he started to search for power, until he found the _Secret Fabergé Egg_, a powerful mystical artifact build by the Farbegé family for the Russian Tzars. Normally hidden, the March Hare had stole it even under a powerful security and discovered its shapshifting powers. 

Then, two years ago, he undergone for what he thought was his freedom: by using the _Secret Fabergé_'s magical power, he undergone a transformation as a Rabbitman, a half-man, half-rabbit monstrousity.

He had grown even more intelligent, and his rabbity hyperactivity turns him even more dangerous, putting him under the Centurion's radar.

However, he was clever enough to hide in his so-called "burrows", his hiding points all around the world and worked into the _Secret Fabergé_'s powers. 

Then, he discovered he could lace some of the _Secret Fabergé_'s magical powers into objects or people by illuminating them with special lights passing through the powerful magical artifact. 

And then, an idea snapped into his mind, while he was eating, reading and thinking on how to dominate the world, all the same time!

Some months ago, he broke up into Willy Wonka's Chocolate Factory and stole some of the best chocolate recipes. Using some people he abducted as guinea pigs, he irradiated some of the _Secret Farbegé_'s energies under some chocolate and made them eat it.

The effects were immediate: they had gone addicted into the chocolate and, after eating some, started to undergone a Rabbitman transformation as himself did! In some days, he had a good number of Rabbitman mooks to help him into the plan his mind started to formulate and now he was putting into action.

#### Extra:  ___The Rabbitshifter Chocolate Eggs:___ 

One of the most delicious kind of Chocolate Eggs someone could taste, it was made by The March Hare to turn people, specially children, into a kind of half-man, half-rabbit/hare monstrousity, under The March Hare's dominion.

To do this, The March Hare used the mystical energies from _The Secret Farbegé Egg_, a special mystical artefact built by the Farbegé family and stolen by The March Hare. My heating the chocolate under a kettle specially illuminated by the Farbegé Egg, the mystical energies are absorbed by the chocolate, giving him an ___Almost Addict Taste___ and the ___Shapeshifters properties___ that make the Rabbitshifter Chocolate Eggs so infamous. 

Everyone that eats this Chocolate Egg starts to turn into a _Rabbitmen_. The transformation is not all-or-nothing: each time the character eats more and more of the Rabbitshifter, he grows more and more a Rabbitman, under the control of The March Hare. After 5 times the character eats, the Character is turned a Rabbitman. Each egg eaten provides +1 at the difficult to resist another shot, if possible.
