## Introduction

The Company is in the Arctic, a snowy and cold barren wilderness, with some green patches, with forests, glades and meadows here and there. The Company had gone there for some specific reason, perhaps looking for clues about their _Heart's Desires_, maybe hearing something about _Father Christmas_ and perhaps looking for some kind of magical help (or not). They stop at a local village near the Christmas Village, that they can spot in the middle of the white barren wild when the local people will mention that the villagers that works in the Christmas Village sounds worried.

If the Company talk with them, they will explain that Santa (another name for _Father Christmas_) is worried if his reindeer could not fly this year. They will explain that Santa's reindeers are  like any other reindeer found in the region's glades and woods but treated in a special way with a special magic compound provided by the Fairies to give them their iconic magical abilities of flying and wondrous speed.

If the characters look for Santa, he will receive them in the Christmas Village and will explain that he would actually be unable to travel the world without resorting into the Fairy Dust provided by a friendly Fairy, the _Sugarplum Fairy_, which is mixed in the reindeer food of hay, carrots and sugar. But she couldn't be found in recent times, and the power of the Fairy Dust is waning, which turns dangerous for him to travel through the sky as he could fall from the sky to death when the Fairy Dust magic wanes. But he will do it if needed, even if ___this could put his life under strife___:

> _"I can not help but fulfill my obligations at Christmas, especially when many children see in me the only hope of some happiness, but I prefer to avoid the risks as far as I can. I'm also worried I took some action that bothered the Sugarplum Fairy and made me to lose her friendship. I would just like to understand what happened, if so."_

> + ___Problem:___ Santa needs to deliver  the Christmas presents, but the fairy that provided the Fairy Dust needed for the reindeer flies did not contact him this year;
> + ___Solution:___ Find this Fairy and see what can be done until Christmas

## Investigation

The  Christmas Village's Elves will say that the only one that can produce this Fairy Dust, the Sugarplum Fairy, looks like disappeared for some time. It is known that she and the Ice Queen have some old qualms, but they never thought that the Ice Queen would violate the old time traditions of nonviolence among Fairies.

If they return to the village they came before, the people there will say that some evil creatures had grown into activity in the region. Especially at those time of ___Eternal Nights___, where ___the Sun is almost a magical blessing___, evil creatures have always liked into attacking and doing mean actions nearby villages. And while the _Christmas Village_ protects nearby villages, as many artisans in the area help the Elves to produce the toys that are distributed at Christmas, this year things had grown even more dangerous!

The villagers will mention also the Ice Queen's castle, which lies off the region, as well as a Dark Forest. The Castle is ___Made of Pure Ice___, and there she lives surrounded by her lackeys, like Trolls, Hags and other evil creatures. But the most terrible are the ___Cold Hearted___: they are called this way because their ___hearts are frozen___ through the evil magical arts that she possesses and uses.

To turn things worse, all the villagers know that the Ice Queen hates the Sugarplum Fairy with all her strength: first, because the Sugarplum Fairy is the ___Master of the Midnight Sun and Northern Lights___; And secondly because it is a known fact that the Sugarplum Fairy is much more powerful than the Ice Queen.

The villagers  will also says  that ___Sugarplum Fairy's Hut___ is in the middle of the nearby Glen, halfway between Christmas Village and the Ice Queen's Ice Castle.

## In-Between - Arctic

The Arctic's snowy wilderness surrounds and encompasses the various locations nearby the Christmas Village, and in this winter the Arctic it is ___Especially Frosty and Dangerous___. There's many things that can happen to those fool enough to not prepare themselves for the harsh environment. However, knowing the environment well, life can be somewhat easy and even enjoyable: some groups of hunters and shepherds of elk and reindeer lives in the area, the hunt for creatures such as wolves, elks, hares and rabbits being their way of life.

At certain points of the white wilderness, there are small woods where pines and redwoods and similar trees offer some shelter from the snow and cold, and some pine cones, almonds, and even occasional blackberries for food. However, here are risks too, in the form of packs of Wolves and Foxes looking for fresh meat.

### Monsters

+ ___Evil Wolves and Foxes___ poses some danger here. They often attack by surprise those who are unwary enough to pass near their burrows. They have +2 to attack in group and surprise, and -2 to fight when in disadvantage.
+ ___Trolls___ are creatures that live in the forest and eat basically anything, but prefer fresh meat when they can get it. They are extremely strong, receiving +2 while attacking using their giant bats, but at the same time they are very dumb, getting -2 when trying to do any kind of strategy, including defending themselves.
+ ___Ice Giants___ are usually honored, and just want to stay on theirs. However, occasionally a Giant can go mean enough to seek to maul anything that comes near them. Due to their size, they receive +2 to attack smaller creatures with their huge weapons and knuckles, but they also receive -2 to defend themselves from these creatures' attacks.

### Hazards

- The Arctic's ___Intense Cold___  is extremely dangerous: if the Company is  not properly dressed, consider that they suffer  ___Fair (+2)___ Cold Attacks each turn, Defending with _Physique_. Characters can ___Freeze Over___ by the intense cold
- The ___Darkness___ in Arctic at this time of year makes it harder to see things, causing +2 difficulty in all _Investigate_ involving sight;
- The ___Frozen Cliffs___ are dangerous because, with the ___Darkness___, is hard to see the Cliffs. Consider a variable  ___Danger___ for the cliffs, depending on the height of them. This will be the difficulty to _Overcome_ to notice and pass through the Cliff (no matter the method) and the damage to be provoked in case of failure in the notice (by fall, cuts, frostbite, etc...)
- The __Frozen Lakes___ can be great ways to cross to get into places or to obtain provisions by fishing, but they are very dangerous, maybe even more than the Cliffs. Use the same ___Danger___ system of the Cliffs, but if a characters got  inside a Lake, besides suffering damage caused by ___Danger___, this is also the difficulty of rescuing the person from inside the Lake, which can mean that there's a chance of a character to Froze to Death there!

### Denizens

All the inhabitants of the Arctic are somewhat united, due to the region's harshness. On the one side, they can be people in solidarity with the needy, even if occasionally suspicious; On the other hand, they may be cruel creatures, who are held together by a powerful and irascible leader.

+ The ___Santa's Elves___ are ___Feisty, Harmless___ and ___Tiny___. They are torn between _Create_ new toys and gifts and _Build_ things, improving from things they already know how to build. All of them have Good (+3) or better _Crafts_;
+ The ___Villagers from Nearby the Christmas Village___ are usually ___Orderly, Workers___ and ___Suspicious with foreigners___. They are torn  between _Help travelers_ lost in the middle of the snowy expanses and _Close themselves to their Chests_, because they already have problems enough. All of them have Good (+3) or better _Rapport_;
+ The ___Arctic Wolves' packs___ are usually ___Cruel, Trustful___ and ___Territorials___, torn between _Hold their Territory_, accepting what Nature gives them and just keeping outsiders away and _Take all they can_, not worrying about tomorrow. All of them have Good (+3) or better _Stealth_;
+ Arctic ___Foxes___ are often ___Treacherous, Wise___ and ___Sneaky___, torn between just _Observe_ events, and with this to know how and when to act, and _Act_ in order to get what they want, not worrying about tomorrow. All of them have have Good (+3) or better  _Deceive_;
+ The ___Evil Crows___ that live in the woods are ___Treacherous, Perceptive___ and ___Boasty___, torn between _Save their knowledge to themselves_ and thereby gain the advantage at the right time and _Using them against their enemies_, eliminating them once and for all. All of them have Good (+3) or better _Lore_;
+ The ___Owls___ living in the woods are ___Wise, Perceptive___ and ___Mysterious___, torn between _Saving their knowledge to themselves_ and thereby gaining the advantage at the right time and _Sharing them with the people in need_, helping people lost in the icy forests. All of them have Good (+3) or better _Lore_;
+ The ___Trolls___ who live in the middle of the frozen expanses are ___Dumb, Stubborn___ and ___Bullies___, torn between _Care about themselves_  and leave others in peace and _Destroy everything_ in their bloodlust. All of them have Great (+4) or better _Fight_;
+ The Tragic ___Cold Hearted___, results of the Ice Queen's magical experiences, are ___Cold, Cruel___ and ___Trustful___, torn between _Protect the Ice Queen_, their "creator", and _Leave her to her own fate_, taking care of only itself. All of have Great (+4) or better _Will_;
+ The smart ___Snowmen___, magical creatures that were created by Sugarplum Fairy's magic are ___Weak, Bonny___ and ___Canny___, torn  between _Helping Santa_, even with the risks involved, and _Stay out of trouble_ due to their weakness. All of them have Good (+3) or better _Stealth_;

### Secret

The Sugarplum Fairy was actually captured by the Ice Queen: usually the Ice Queen would not be able to do this, but in a moment of carelessness at the beginning of winter, the Sugarplum Fairy took her bath and left her Magic Wand far  enough for the Queen's Wolves and Cold Hearted to abduct her from her house. The Fairy's Hut is still all messed up and proper tests will reveal this story.

The Ice Queen had captured the Sugarplum Fairy for a simple motive: she desperately needs the Fairy Dust that only the Fairy can produce for her selfish ends, such as creating her lieutenants, the Cold Hearted, from children kidnapped from elsewhere by her evil forces, and to maintain her own young and pretty semblance.

In fact, the Ice Queen is a powerful and evil Fairy, already quite old. Her natural look was once as beautiful as the one she keeps using the Sugarplum Fairy's Dust, but in fact her present semblance is the one of a horrible hag, almost as abominable as a Troll and more evil than one.

Without the characters' knowing, the actual Fairy Dust stock is waning, and with it Sugarplum Faerie's time: although she herself does not need the Fairy Dust, she would not go low and  prepare some for the Ice Queen. The Dust stock that the Fairy had was stolen by the Ice Queen when she kidnapped her, and is already waning. Obviously, the Ice Queen will do terrible things with Sugarplum to try to get more Dust, or even better the Fairy Dust Recipe, which was not in any of the books that the Fairy had (and she stolen).

A Secret that the Fairy will be able to comment on with the Company if needed: there is a ___single copy of the Fairy Dust Recipe___, buried in a special place underneath the floor of her hut, and hidden inside a small glass flask. However, the paper where the Recipe is written is a ___Magic Paper___, laced with some magics by the Fairy to reveal its secrets only ___For those with the Fairy's Mark___, a special breath that she gives on those she trusts that contains part of her magic, enough for the Paper to know that the person in question may use this Recipe. It is possible, for a proficient Magic User, to try to reveal the secret by Force, but it will demand Magic tests. And a failure can result in the Paper being destroyed.

The Fairy is hoping to escape, but between giving Fairy Dust (or the Recipe) to the Ice Queen and dying, she will prefer the second option as a no-brainer.

### Snags

+ _Harsh Cold:_ One of the nearby Villages needs desperately some food and wood for fire, and the Company is the only option, since the adults are looking for hunting. The characters will be tested in their kindness, but if they pass in this _Test of Kindness_, some of the old women in the village will remember useful information and give useful tips and equipment to the Company.
+ _Mourning Mothers:_ some mothers lost their children, which the Ice Queen picked up and turned into _Cold Hearted_. The Company characters can Promise to turn them back into ___or___  at least release them of such big suffering, and the Mothers they will offer clues on to how to reach the Ice Queen Castle.
+ _The Lost Elves:_ Some Santa Elves came to get the Fairy Dust for Santa but  had to hide to not be captured by the Ice Queen when they saw the Sugarplum Fairy being kidnapped by the Ice Queen. A Promise of Rescuing the Sugarplum Fairy can make the Elves lend useful items, but if the characters leave them to their own fate this will ensure ___Coal in their socks___ those Christmas (if there'll be one).
+ _The Grinch:_ A really sullen creature, with thick, ugly green hair, is sick of all this Christmas mess, and will do anything to keep things quiet for him. A promise to end all this confusion will make him help with certain evil creatures he knows well. Otherwise, he may disrupt the characters affairs, giving the position of the characters in the worst possible moments.
+ _Jack Frost:_ A strange-looking kid who does not know what he is, actually he is one of the first _Cold Hearted_, ___but he still have some consciousness___. He is trying to understand what he had became and how to protect the Human Village from where he came from. If the characters Promise to help him, he will go with them to confront the Ice Queen.

### The Ice Queen

A very cruel Wicked Fairy, the Ice Queen stole the position of the Old Ice Queen, a Mortal turned a Fairy by the Magic of the Seasons. While her predecessor preserved and respected the cycle of life, the current Ice Queen wants only power, and for that she wants to dominate all the creatures of the Arctic. And what better way to prevent than by subjecting them to Extreme Cold and making them cold creatures, both body and soul, the ___Cold Hearted___.

However, she still faces an obstacle: Father Christmas, who still looks the hope of warmth even in the coldest winter! And there is also the Sugarplum Fairy, which does not offer her the powers she wants. To achieve her goals, she is capable of everything, including killing the Sugarplum Fairy if necessary
