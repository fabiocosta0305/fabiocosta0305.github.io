## Request for Aid

The Company arrives at a Village in the middle of a valley, surrounded by a typically beautiful Enchanted Forest. The Village lays near to a mountain, from which comes a smoke as if it were a volcano or as if there were a chimney.

The village are made of garish colored, beautiful houses. It is noticeable the intense trade, as it's near a river and to the path that leads to the Valley exit, from where caravans of merchants come and go, taking advantage of the village as a trading outpost among themselves without the need to go to the Near Kingdoms.

One curious thing the Company will notice is that you can't find cocoa or chocolate anywhere in the Village. The villagers will explain that this is not normal, not at all, as the famous _Easter Egg Chocolate Factory_ is in a burrow under the Egg Mountain (the mountain where they could see the chimney). The smoke from the top is small for the time of year, and many of the villagers miss the activity of the Rabbits, since many of the villagers are themselves chocolatiere that worked for the Easter Bunny at those times, many learned the craft with the Rabbits or even with Easter Bunny itself.

The characters will then be sought by one of the Egg Factory Rabbits, who will take them to it: they will realize that, despite the small proportions, they can walk normally through the Factory.

The factory is huge, carved into more than half of the Mountain internals: one of the Valley's natural waterfalls has been pulled from its course to feed the watermill which supplies power to the machinery, and part of the water is used into the boilers for the Chocolate conching and for other needs.

However the Company can see that the Rabbits are flabebrgasted, but not because of activity, quite the opposite: the lack of activity is making them touchy of such anxiety!

Then they are taken to a room that looks like the Factory's control room, where they see a Bit Rabbit, with snowy fur, albino eyes and a small pink button of a leathery nose at the tip of the muzzle. He wears clothes as if he was a human, in a way that resembles the _Alice in Wonderland_'s White Rabbit. However, the characters will find that he looks a bit sick: his long ears are floppy and the characters may notice that his chees are not pinkish, as it should be, but rather green, as if he had eaten something that made him gone queasy!

## Problem

> _"You must know about the Easter Egg tradition: every year I travel all around the Kingdoms, hiding chocolate eggs during the Easter season. This year, however, I'm not feeling very well. I think someone put some kind of poison on my food that made me sick, and I will not get well enough until the time I shoud hide our chocolate eggs. And, if that were not enough, I discovered that someone stole my __Cookbook__ and cutted my chocolate supply lines, by robbing the caravans! Who could be doing this, I don't know, but I believe that would be someone really selfish, to want too much to have all my chocolate eggs only for himself."_

> + ___Problem:___ Not only did the Easter Bunny fail to make eggs because of the raw material shortage, and he had the recipe cookbook stolen, but also something or someone managed to put him sick!
> +  ___Solution:___ Recover the Cookbook, get the raw material and ready the Easter eggs!

 <!-- excerpt -->
 
## Investigation

The Egg Factory Rabbits will always mention the fact that since some days they no longer received any cocoa, chocolate, and other raw materials for the eggs, just in the most critical time for the chocolate eggs manufacturing. Even looking upon to merchants from villages, towns, and even nearby kingdoms, they have discovered that any supply that anything that can be used on Easter eggs is cut off, to the point that even chicken eggs are being stolen. There's a shortage on chocolate all around!

They Rabbits will also  mention that goblins thieves were seen in the nearby Forest, that is Enchanted Forest as everyone knows. Those goblins attack occasionally, but not with the intensity and panache they had recently.

In addition, one of the biggest oppositor of the Easter Bunny, Rumpelstiltskin, was recently seen in the middle of the Forest. Usually considered petty, no one knows which are their goals.

As for the ___Cookbook___, some of the  Egg Factory Rabbits were taking him to Mother Goose when they were attacked by the goblins thieves and it was stolen. If it was not the Easter Bunny disease and the chocolate shortage, they could still make the eggs, adjusting the recipes slowly until they found the spot. It would reduce the chocolate eggs variety, but it would be possible.

If someone asks if any of the Egg Factory Rabbits could take on the role of the Easter Bunny, they will show the difference in size: the Easter Bunny is the size of a child, while the Egg Factory Rabbit are much smaller, rabbit-sized.

They will say that there's a desperated measure that has never been taken: when the ___Easter Bunny had undergone into this Mantle___, there was created a way a human being could to pass through it, through the ___Enchanted Clothes___, magical garments created by the ___Fairy Godmothers___ for the Rabbit as a Emergency solution. A person who put on the Clothes ___takes up the form and some of the skills of the Easter Bunny until the egg distribution is completed___.

Of course there are clauses about who can use the ___Enchanted Clothes___, and they are not with the Egg Factory, but are under the caring of one of the Fairy Godmothers who made them, Mirana, who lives in the middle of the Forest. She is considered one of the wisest of the Fairy Godmothers, and therefore one of the most powerful, and she's able to see through people's heart: ___she will not allow anyone to wear the Enchanted Clothes for selfish reasons___, but can help those who are selfless.

About the ___Enchanted Forest___, everyone will say that it is ___Home of all kind of creatures, good and bad___, and that there are ___Hospitality Laws___ that must always be respected, at the risk of suffering all kinds of tricks and deceives, from only mildly humiliating to potentially fatal. In addition, disrespect for such norms marks those that make them as ___Unworthy___ (a Curse that can be put on the _Seventh Aspect_ of a character). Every villager knows some of the Laws, but none knows them all, as they vary from creature to creature. However, any knowledge can be useful in this case.


## In-Between: The Stranded Forest

The Enchanted Forest surrounding the Chocolate Factory and the nearby village is the source of all kinds of game and food for humans, as well as firewood to warm the winter chill. However, it is also home to good and bad creatures of all kinds, especially in the _Hidden Locations_ where the Fairies meet. Animals of all kinds can be found here, and many magical creatures also live here, as well as witches and monastic sages and other creatures.

### Aspects

+ ___Home of Good and Bad Creatures___
+ ___Hidden Locations that should be respected___
+ ___The Hospitality Laws must always be respected___

### Monsters

+ The Forest has many ___Wolves___ and similar predators, which have _+2 to attack in pack_ and _-2 to fight when alone_;
+ ___Trolls___ are creatures that live in the forest and eat basically anything but prefer fresh meat when they can get it. They are extremely strong, _receiving +2 while attacking using their giant tacos_, but at the same time they are very dumb, getting _-2 when attempting any kind of smart strategy, including for defense_.
+ ___Goblins Thieves___ occasionally attack travelers, including the characters. They receive _+2 when attacking in greater numbers or by ambushes_. However, they are cowards who receive _-2 as much as they need to attack alone or show courage!_ 

### Hazards

+ The ___Paths and Leeways___ are a danger not by them, but by what happens when they do not follow them. If a character fails a test to follow the path (usually _Fair (+2)_), it can go into ___Hidden Locations___ where it should not be, and this can be a serious problem;
+ The ___Hidden Locations___ are meeting and congregational points of several creatures that inhabit the Forest. Going into one of them uninvited violates ___Hospitality Laws___, and some really evil creatures love to pick characters marked ___Unworthy___ or those who just get into their Hidden Locations to devour;

If, at any time, the characters violate the ___Hospitality Laws___, they will be marked with an _Seventh Aspect_, which they can not Invoke. It will require a really serious Test of Kindness for the characters to come back to be considered worthy of such ___Laws___. ___Unworthy___ characters will not normally receive desafe haven in the ___Hidden Locations___ and will not even have access to its resources.

### Secrets

The Enchanted Forest is home of many mystical creatures who may need help. The Hospitality Laws are something to be taken very seriously. However, every situation where the characters help some of these creatures can grant the characters some help aftr. However, when characters violate the Laws, they may end up imprisoned, cursed, or even with their lives under risk!

In fact, there is a whole community of people who are Accursed, unable to return to their homes because of the curses imposed because their disregard for the Laws. The characters may wish to rescue some of them, but this will be complicated because of the powerful forces involved.

### Snags

+ ___The Doppelgäenger:___ one of the characters will see a clone of himself. This clone is known as _Doppelgäenger_, or _Double_, and can either be sent there by some kindly entity, and therefore ready to help the character, or be an evil entity that wants to kill the character and take his place. Many times, however, it will only appear for the original character, or when it is not present in the group;
+ ___The Old Hag:___ An old woman lives alone in a house in the woods, and everyone thinks she is a Hag. If the characters try to attack her, she will defend herself and, if defeated, will curse the characters. Otherwise, she will be willing to help the characters, as she is an old friend of the Easter Bunny, and knows all about the Enchanted Clothes, including where Mirana is;
+ ___The little girl:___ a girl lost in the Forest will ask the characters for help her to get through it safely and, with that, go to her grandmother's house. She wears a red hood and carries a beautiful basket filled with delicious food. If the characters help her, they may fall into another quest, which can make them take too long.

+ ___The Trapped Goblin:___ A little Goblin is in trouble, after falling into the trap of a hunter.

However, he may be able to take advantage of this situation, even if he is at risk;
+ ___The Man with the Donkey Head:___ This strange man with a donkey head was a Lumberjack who, unknowingly, violated the Hospitality Laws of some of the Forest Magical Creatures, and received as a penalty this humiliating transformation, being ___Unable to Speak, only Bray___. If the characters make their way to understand what he wants and decide to help him, they might get some ___help___ in the future. However, if they end up leaving him behind, or worse, attacking him, there is a chance that the Fairy Godmothers will not like it at all and put a __Curse__ on one or more of them, through ___Magical Transformations___

## Rumpelstiltskin and The Easter Rabbit Cookbook

The main key to the mystery involving the disappearance of chocolate loads to the Rabbit Egg Factory is _Rumpelstiltskin_.

This Goblin is one of the most selfish of all of them, to the point that even among these evil creatures he is considered an outcast. Intelligent and manipulative, not infrequently he has reached the point of using those of his own kind for his own goals.

Recently, he grew into the ambition of power over the Kingdoms near the Easter Rabbit Egg Factory. However, he realized that dominating all realms through force would be impossible. The Kingdoms are far more powerful than the Forest people. And even if he could get some of the Goblins to fight at his side, he would be crushed for sure.

Therefore, he would have to dominate them via cunning.

And it was when he found out about the ___Enchanted Clothes___ and began to formulate his scheme.

First, he ordered his Goblins Thieves to steal all Chocolate and other raw materials that the Rabbits from the Chocolate Egg Factory asked for: either from local caravans or from those in the distant ___Golden and Silk Road___ that crosses the Desert to the the Kingdoms of the East, he made sure that not a gram of chocolate reached anywhere in the Near Kingdoms and, indirectly, the Chocolate Egg Factory.

Then he put one of his Goblins, under disguise via his mystical illusions, inside the Egg Factory,  that managed to steal ___Easter Bunny's Magic Cookbook___.

By reading it, he began to develop a kind of magical chocolate, extremely tasty, but which induces anyone who eats it to submit themselves to Rumpelstiltskin. Making those eggs and testing them on children he imprisoned and used as guinea pigs, the results were even better: the children themselves eventually became ___Goblins___ under their will.

At last, what he needs now is somehow steal the ___Enchanted Clothes___. He knows that they are with Mirana the Fairy Godmother, but he doesn't want to deal with her himself, because he knows Mirana is extremely powerful.

So he made his disguised goblin at the Egg Factory contaminate the Easter Bunny's food and water with a light but long-lasting poison that would make him sick for a long time. Now he's just waiting for someone unsuspecting to go to Mirana's house for the Enchanted Clothes and get them, so he can steal them and and use them to become the "Easter Bunny" for long enough to spread his Magic Eggs and put everyone in the  Valley under his will!

## The Enchanted Clothes

Mirana, the Fairy Godmother, is the one behind the whole idea of ​​the Easter Bunny. After discovering about a certain human family that helped others through this ancient myth, she decided that she would offer them the option to continue this mission, making them enchanted creatures with very long life and the shape of the Easter Bunny.

For this, she worked with her friend, the Sugarplum Fairy, a magic similar to the Santa's, where from time to time a person has the option to become the Easter Bunny, based on accepting the Easter Clause (similar to Christamassy Santa Clause) when wearing the ___Easter Bunny Enchanted Clothes___ and so taking his ___Mantle___. Beside to the one that was used by the current Easter Bunny, there is a ___small-scale variant of the same Enchanted Clothes___ one she keeps for emergencies.

Mirana will be very rigid and severe to test those who wants to  use the ___Enchanted Clothes___: she knows the powers it gives and the doors that it opens, in every sense, since many of the Kingdoms follow the Easter Eggs traditions. But if you allow someone to wear the ___Enchanted Clothes___, she will make clear the station that he now have.

The ___Enchanted Clothes___ look like a great ___Rabbit Costume___, something like _Alice in Wonderland_'s White Rabbit Costume, with Checkered  Jacket and White Pants, made from (and smelling of) rabbit fur. Once someone VOLUNTARILY dresses, he takes on the ___Mantle of the Easter Bunny___. In the case of ___Enchanted Clothes___ with Mirana, the magic has a limited duration: until midnight after Easter. Only characters who volunteer and have no other spells, curses or promises under them (in short, those who have no  _Seventh Aspect_) can take on the ___Easter Bunny's Mantle (albeit temporarily)___. The only exception is if someone made a Promise to the Easter Bunny: that person can ___take the Mantle___ because it is considered a rewritting of the _Seventh Aspect_.

+ The ___Easter Bunny's Enchanted Clothes___ are the ___Clothes that enforces the Easter Bunny Mantle into those who wears it___ (at least temporarily, in the case of those with Mirana). He therefore offers the bearer all sorts of skills necessary to deliver the Chocolate Eggs in their proper place. It is created using the Nest's _Talismans_ rule.
  + The user receives _Great (+4) __Athletics___ and +2 in all tests related to Physical Prowess with the Legs, including jumpin, and can't have any Aspect related to barriers of physical nature or tireness _Forced or Hostile Invoked_ against him. If he already has _Great (+4) __Athletics___ (+4) or better, he gets +2 on all _Athletics_ tests, cumulative with the Prowess bonuses.
  + The user receives _Great (+4) __Notice___ and +2 on all hearing, sight, or smell tests. If you already have _Great (+4) __Notice___ or better, you receive +2 on all _Notice_ tests (cumulative with the hearing bonus)
  + The user is now recognized as the ___Easter Bunny___ (in the case of the clothes that are with Mirana, just during the Easter period). This becomes an Aspect on the character;
  + The ___Enchanted Clothes___ have a Protection Mechanism: if someone ___Unworthy___ try to put their hands on them, they automatically teleport to Mirana. In the case of those who are with her, it teleports itself as soon as, after Easter, the user decides to leave it behind, undressing it and placing it somewhere far away, such as at the foot of a tree or at the bend of a river.
