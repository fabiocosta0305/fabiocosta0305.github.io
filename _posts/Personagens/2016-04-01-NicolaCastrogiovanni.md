## Centurion Stunts

+ _The "Good Enough" Game:_ Because Nicola is very optimistic in all things, twice a session he can ask and receive some needed help from others, as long he can ask for it or he talked with those people before. This help came in play as an Scenario Aspect (like _My Goodness, you need some clean clothes!_ or _A Place to Stay at those freezing nights_), with one Free Invocation. He can't use this to do harm to others, but he can use this to help himself and/or others. Those Aspects stays as long as reasonable. He can combine the two uses into a Aspect with two invocations, under the same rules.

## Other Stunts

+ Because I believe that _Everyone have a Good Heart_, I receive +2 to _Create Advantages_ by discovering (or creating/putting) good Aspects on someone _Carefully_
+ _Thespian:_ Because Nicola's a consummate actor, he has no penalty when attempts to impersonate someone much older , much taller or shorter than himself, with a radically different accent than himself, or the like.

## Appearance

Nicola looks as a somewhat chubby, although strong, Italian-blooded kid, between 10 and 12. He has a mix of dirty and strawberry blonde hair, and some tufts of ginger. He have red-blushed chin and a petite nose, and freckles. He dress somewhat like a newsie, a simple shirt-and-trousers combo, with the only things he still have from his deceased parents still with him: a Holy Mother scapulary (from his mother) and a red-checkered casquette that looks a little oversized in his head (from his father).

## Behavior

Nicola is a very kind-hearted kid and there's no bad time with him: he's that kind of kid that, even after being sprayed by a skunk, thrashed by a bully, put into the garbage bin, hitted by rotten tomatoes and stinky sewer, and left under a storm rain he still coult say _"I'm all right, thank you"_. He has a cheerful behavior and is very well-mannered, a smile always in his face.

## History

Nicola's parents died a little after his birth, when they came to US. Since them, he was living from foster home to another. For some reason, even he being very well-mannered and well-behaviored, all their foster parents hate them. Perhaps the fact he liked to care for stray dogs (and left them go when they're healthy again), or because he shared his school lunch with the local hoboes, or even by the fact he came with some apples, books or new clothes as by sheer luck, but all their foster home had kicked him. 

In fact, in the last one those kickings were as literal as literal can be: his foster brother was a very great bully that (with some conivence from his parents) trashed the crap out from Nicola every day. This until the day the circus came to the city, and Nicola found the biggest Mentalist from all time, _Don Cagliostro_. Nicola thought that run with the circus would be a better thing for him and for his foster family (less a mouth to feed and so). And he chosed to go with the circus.

When he was found by the circus crew, Don Cagliostro (in fact, Frederick Van Der Merwe, a half-boer, half-english South-Africa born magician and mentalist) had taken him and took the responsibility to teach and care for Nicola (unknowlingly for both, because of Nicola's powers as a _Spirit of Optimism_). Nicola very fast had learned some basic chores in the circus and also had learned some acts as a clown, magician and other circus acts.

Nicola still don't know too much about the Century Club and so, but Don (as he calls his mentor) shown him enough to understand that his destiny is bigger than he knows. 

And he knows that, in the end, everything will be fine.
