## Appearance

Oregon is skinny and black, with bushy and full hair, always smiling. He's a great _newsie_, mainly because he has a knack on read and understand the contents of the newspaper he sell. He's always under his _newsie_ clothes, even at school, if possible.

## Behavior 

Oregon has a great smile in his face no matter what, because he always get what he needs and can get always safely, no matter how big the mess he is. Besides, he have a superior mind prowess, so it's not that weird that the big kahunas from _J.P.Morgan_ buy their newspapers from himself, and even the great guys like _Andrew Carnegie_ and _J.P.Morgan_ himself came to him for the newspapers. He put him under good eyes by his boss, Mr. _Jonah Pendrik_, from _Pendrik Press_

## History

Born under the first chimes from January 1st, 1901, little Oregon Cadmus was named this way by his father, as a memento to the State from where he came, doing is parent's opposite movement, that ran from Texas, Arkansas and Virginia during the Slavery and Civil War times. Oregon's parents, Will and Mary Joanne, came to New York for working.

Although still a little backwater, as it was a little away from New Jersey's capital city, Trenton, New York already shows some clues on what it would turn on in the future, in part thanks fr people like Carnegie and Morgan, that stabilised their economical empires from New York. Obviously not everyone was happy to work for the _Robber Barons_, that were people with high education, commercial knack and, sometimes, unscrupulous about the ways to grow big in power.

And it was under this scenario that Will Cadmus started to work at _Pendrik Press_, learn the job as a typographer and printmaker, and others. Ms. Mare Joanne was a teacher into a local school, while little Oregon turned as a typical _newsie_. With time and newspaper reading, he came with a great idea: instead on do the same of other _newsies_, by selling newspapers at the _ferry boat_ between mainland and Manhattan, he got into the higher stakes, going everyday after school to the flourishing _Wall Street_.

The bet paid itself in time: everyday after the school, he passed into _Pendrik Press_ and took a big bunch of newspapers, including one that was a little substandard to be sold. This is the one he read until he got at Wall Street. By doing this, he could talk about the news and express his ideas about the main stories. This  way he could attract attention and sell his papers by all the big guys (and small ones, too) that was there. After selling all the newspapers, he got back to _Pendrik Press_ and looked if it would be profitable take a new "round" selling more newspapers.

Surely many _newsies_ want that place, as it was very lucrative, and by this they tried to solve Oregon's problem by knuckles. But when you occasionally sells papers for Mr Astor, Carnegie, and Morgan, and they talk with you in civil terms, obviously mess with you is a very big of a mess. If it was not enough, even the police officers don't get too boastly against Oregon.

But there's something growing into Oregon's heat, that even his father perceive: no matter how big New York is, it's becoming small for little Oregon Cadmus. And even Mr. Jonah Pendrik note this...

For both sakes...
