## Centurion Stunt

+ _Vivid Dreams_ Marcellus can use his storyteller skills to induce people into a "fictional" setting where he can put some details and they only get out when Marcellus wants _or_ by accomplish some objective he put in the moment he call this. _Two times per session_ he puts in game a _Dream-land_ Aspxet, with a Free Invoke. Marcellus' player need to describe what this _Dream-land_ is all about, and the objective to be accomplished. The Aspect stay in game while the targets were "locked" into those Dream-land (max. one scene or until Marcellus is _take out_)

## Appearance

Marcellus is a very uncommon looking kid: hay colored hair into a traditional haircut, green eyes, a little skinny, but with an elegant cut. He is always impeccably well-dressed no matter what.

## Behavior

Marcellus looks like (and is) somewhat out of reality. But take this as a _Peter Pan Syndrome_, you didn't understood him: he's clever and very aware of what's happening. He just likes to find the most inspiring, fantastic, out-of-box, uncommon sollution.

## History

Marcellus is from a family with great tradition in the racounteurs, storyteller, circus, _vaudeville_, theater and all kinds of storytelling. His father has blood from the first _King Lear_, and her mother can track his ancestor to the _Comedia Dell'Arte_.

When Marcellus was born a little after the End of Year presentation, when 20th Century was born from the ashes of 19th Century, they felt in their hearts the blessings of Aesop, Thalia, Melpomen, Clio and all the Muses amd Deities and Patron Saints for arts and artistes.

This was shown as true very soon: when he was two, he already learned how to read. With three, debuted into stage. With five, already was rehearsing for important roles.

It was when his family was found by that weird man called _Aesop_, that said that Marcellu should be sent to the _Century Club_, a society of gentlemen and women that is focused into mankind's evolution, to be tuteled. He wasn't in the club himself, but he had very important contacts into the _Club_ that could teach hum and work son Marcellus could develop his talents and put them at work as much as possible.

And so, _Malakar_ (his stage name) started to get into his own story. His own tale. His own Fable.
