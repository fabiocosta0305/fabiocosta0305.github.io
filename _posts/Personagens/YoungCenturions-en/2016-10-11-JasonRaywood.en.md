## History

Jason was born in Lousiana, a land of, some people says, faith and sin. New Orleans was always a center of religion and a center of sin and seduction, as someone says. In this land, Olivier and Marie Raywood were some of the biggest predators in the card tables. No pne won them in the poker. Many myths came about them, including some about pacts with demons, _loas_ and _vodoun_, but the fact was they just knew how to avail their chances of win or lose and know how to deal with this with the better profit.

It was in January 1st, 1901 that Marie, while still playing poker, felt the first contraptions and, in a few seconds, gave birth for the son she was expecting, that she called Jason.

With time, little Jason was always showing his talent for games, winning against other kids, older, more experienced and bigger than himself into every kind of game: Ludo, Chess, Draughts, etc...

But in fact he had impressed a weird, Sino-English man, that challenge his parents into a serie of games: whist, bridge, Canasta, Rummy, Brazilian Buraco, and, in the end, _poker_. Even playing many of them for the first time, Jason has gone very well, in the end hitting the pot in _poker_ with a _Royal Straight Flush_.

This man, _Charles (Choi) Li-Ang_, didn't made himself abashed and put a new game in the table, that neither Jason not his parents had ever played: half domino, half _poker_, it was very complex. The objective: form a hand composed of four groups of stones from the same suit, either by three or four equal stones, or by a sequence, and a pair of equal stones, by using stones taken from a wall of stones built around the table or by stealing stones the other players discarded.

Charles imagined that he would take the family of beters using _Mahjong_, a complex game they certainly didn't dominated.

They didn't counted, however, with Jason: after four rounds with victories of Charles, Jason won a round with a simple hand. However, his next two hands were some rare hands that she asked about to Charles: the _Seven Pairs_ and the rarer _Thirteen Orphans_.

It was when Charles revealed his objectiv: he was in search of a potential _20th Century Spirit_, people with excepcional capabilities and a adventure lust, both of them Jason have, And it was with some sadness that Charles brought Jason to the New York Chapter of the Century Club, while he teached Jason into lots of game that he sooner dominated.

In the travel, another important feat was when, while passing in Chicado, Jason was challenged by one of the city's Triads for a Mahjong game. A high stake table, sactionated either by Charles and by _Jade Lotus_ leader, Master Lingyu.

During the game, at least in two situations, Jason noted their adversaries where cheating. Obviously he could reveal the cheating, but he decided that, if that was fair game for them, it was also from him, and he learned very fast on how to cheat and won using the same cheats their adversaries did. When the Triad's thugs accused him, he revealed the round, the play and the cheat they used, all of them, putting the goons under big shame, even more that Master Lingyu  knew and was respected by the Triad _Dragon Head_, or _Mountain Master_, the Triad's supreme leader.

And it was when he came to the _Century Club_, and accepted to put his life under stake into preposterous bets with his life and many others' under the stake. After all, life is a game.
