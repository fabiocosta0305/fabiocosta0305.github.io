## Appearance

Knacks is a hobo kid like many others: normally dressed into torn clothes, his normally smudged face is freckled and his red hair is curly and normally messy, as he has few chances to bathe himself. No matter how dirtier he is, he is not seen without his Stetson hat and his lasso.

## Behavior

Knacks is a cheerful kid, as he thinks he left the worst behind when left Texas, and for some reason he knows things will be better now that he left the farm. He doesn't know why, but goes for New York is a great adveture, and there's he'll receive his reward.

## History 

In a small farm in Texas, in the first strokes in January 1st, 1901, a kid was born into a big Scottish-American family. With already 6 mouths to feed, the 7th one was almost too much, and when the kid hadn't took his part in the farm, as she was smaller than them, the other brothers did his life hell... With his parents support.

It was when, when he was 7, he felt the urge to just run away. He didn't know why, but it just made sense to just run away, and he did this, taking a train to Albany. There, he had the _Hobo Life 101_ by some good hoboes, by working cleaning _Ringling Bros_' animal carts for food and clothes. He liked this, and he liked the hobo community in Albany, but he still found the need to get away.

And them he got to Houston, and the cycle repeated: he had came into contact with the hobo community, did some jobs for food and clothes, but them he felt the wanderlust so common into some hobos, but 1000 times stronger, with a specific destination: New York City. 

He didn't understand why New York City has his call on a country boy, someone who likes the stars over his head and the coyote's howling as lullaby. But he felt that some of the answers he was searching for could be found there, and now that he arrived and found that Hobo Queen called _Lady Brigit Danaan_, he thinks that now he'll find those answers, even he needs to take them using his lasso!
