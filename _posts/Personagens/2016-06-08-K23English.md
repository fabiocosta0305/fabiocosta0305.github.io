No one knows when K-23 was created, and neither if he was "born" in Umdaar. What Shukul and the others knows is that K-23 was found into an old Demiurge ruins by them and he was "reactivated" after they hit some of its buttons. 

K-23 don't remember all the details from his past, as centuries passed from the Demiurge's desappearence and the Rise of the Masters of Umdaar. K-23 have lots of knowledge about the Demiurge Era and even from before, which fascinates Grace, the Element-tamer from the Fartime Monastery.

K-23 is on an "observation mode", as he calls itself, trying to understand what made the Demiurge's desappear and the evil Masters of Umdaar rises. Everyone has a hinch that, when K-23 got his answers, Umdaar will not be the same, for the good and the ill.
