Frederick van Der Merwe was born in Cape Town, South Africa, from a Boer diplomat father and an English actress mother. His father was one of the responsible by the returning (although briefly) of Cape Town to the Dutch in 1803. Before the Battle of Blaauwberg, his family emigrated to France and estabilished themself as artists in the Napoleonic France, emigrating from here to there avoiding the wars. In the mean time, young Frederick learned how the things works, by learning how to read as soon as 3 and being able to work at stage as 10. He also learned how to use his knowledge to work his ways into places and around people. Somewhat a honest liar, a real-life Baron of Munchausen, Fred had started his carrer in stage by unknowlingly using his gifts as a Spirit in his shows, to "read" his mentalist target and inducing their to do what he wanted or to read their future. It was this until Doctor Methusaleh got into his way and put him in Danger and he was found by the Century Club. He worked as an informant, an analyst and a scholar, while making fame and money as his alter-ego _Don Cagliostro_, and trying to put himself into the moves of Doctor Methusaleh and discover his objectives. With the century turning, however, he get himself out of the field as much as possible, searching for a specific kid, maybe a _Spirit of Literacy_ as himself. When he found Nicola Castrogiovanni, he found what he needed: a _Spirit of Optimism_ that could be great if correctly taught and doctrinated. And who's better than a _Spirit of Literacy_ to literate someone in something?
