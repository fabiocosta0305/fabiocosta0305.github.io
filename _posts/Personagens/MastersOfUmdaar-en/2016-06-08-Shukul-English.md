Born into one of the fiercest tribes from the Eternal Desert, Shukul received from his father, the most powerful item from his trible, the _Crystal Blade_, before being dumped in the Desert for his rite of passage. When he got back from it, the displacement beast skin as a memento of it, he only fond the ashes from the huts where his people lived. Then he discovered that the Masters of Umdaar had hunted his people as slaves and tormented it into unholy ways.

So, Shukul had searched for power and companions that could help him to thraw the Masters and fight against their injustice. He found allies in many places, from the Usato people in the Green Valley, to the Element-tamers from the Fartime Monastery.

But he knows this is not enough: the Masters are extremely powerful and they are equipped with the Artifacts from the Demiurge. So, his objective is to collect all the power he can to go against and defeat the Masters of Umdaar.
