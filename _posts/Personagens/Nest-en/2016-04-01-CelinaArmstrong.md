>  This character follow the Character  Creation rules from Fate Core,  including         the          specific         things         from  [Nest][1].

From a Family of Gifted Artistes, Celina was linked from her childhood to the arts. So, when she came to Nest, it was only natural that she turned into _The Bestest Magic Apprentice from Conumdrum_, using wits, cunning, and skills to solve the Riddles for everyone, taking all the mysteries and learning about the magic and how "magic" was only a definition for the mysterious and wondrous that you can't really understand.

In our world, after her time in Nest, she get into a major in Acting, perfected her magicians and clown skills, and auditioned for a time at the Ringling Bros. Barnum and Bailey Circus, where she are since some seasons. In the meantime she still maintained contact with Amanda Wesker, her best friend. She still have contact with all her friends, as she's still a kid into her heart, loyal with her friends.

## Skills

|Level | Skill | Skill |Skill  |Skill  | 
|-|-|-|-|-|
| **Great (+4)**   | Crafts        |          |         |         |
| **Good (+3)**    | Lore     |  Rapport    |         |         |
| **Fair (+2)**    | Empathy     | Notice | Investigate |         |
| **Average (+1)** | Will | Athletics   |  Deceive | Provoke |

## Stunts (not at start)

+  _Putting the tongue out:_ She can use _Crafts_ in place of _Provoke_ to Mentally Attack
+ _Sleight of Hand:_ She can use _Crafts_ instead of _Burglary_ to take things or hide things, as long they are small


## Talisman (to be recovered)

### The Sorcerer's Hat

Looking like _Yen Sid_ one from _Fantasia's_ _Sorcerer's Apprendice_, this is **_The Hat With All Magical Knowledge_** from Conundrum. Curiously, this is used only by those who still didn't understand the Riddle of Magic. Anyway, this provides the user with lots of mystical knowledge as long as he uses it.

+  You receive +2 into all magical related rolls, and even when fails, you can be _successful at a minor cost_;
+  Choose one into _Crafts, Lore, Will and Deceive_. You can use this is skill instead of any other in magical-related rolls.
