>  This character follow the Character  Creation rules from Fate Core,  including         the          specific         things         from  [Nest][1].

One of the Asian guys in the neighborhood, Terrance was seen either as a nerdy guy and as a ninja. Not that this was totally false, as he was a Hero of Nest, the _Master Monk from the Eagle Peak_, a mountain chain in Epoch where he "grew", using his dreams as a way to "practice" and find excellence into the Mantis Kung-Fu his family teaches. When he "get out" Nest, he grew up into one of the main trainers for those interested into Kung-Fu, and even some UFC and Mixed-Martial Arts fighters came here to learn some of this.

However, in his heart, he is a more simple guy: he likes simple food, his animals (two dogs and a cat), and caring for some tranquil hobbies, like Go playing, Bonsai caring and Sumi-e (japanese calligraphy) writing. And, day after day, he grows melancholic about those simple time into Nest. Only his close friends, like Amanda, Celine and so, can talk with him about amenities. But he never said for any of them about Nest...

## Skills

|Level | Skill | Skill |Skill  |Skill  | 
|-|-|-|-|-|

## Stunts (not at start)

+  _Element-Bending:_ When taking this Stunt, choose one Element and an Action: anytime you want to do something that is related with that element (the GM says if it is) **AND** can be done by that action, you receive +2 in the roll, and even failing you could be _successful with a small cost_.

## Talisman (to be recovered)

### The Robe of the Weapons Master

A Robe done with a light fabric, it could look for the untrained eye as a simple monk robe, but in fact he is **_The Robe that Holds All Weapons_**. Disputed by many Heroes of Nest during the time, the Robe of the Weapons Master is a robe that is prized by its effect of providing those who wear it with *any* needed weapon as long the robe is worn.

+  You receive +2 into all _Fight_ actions, and even if you fail, you can be _Successful at a minor cost_
+  Once in a scene, do a _Create Advantage_ roll with _Fight_. If successful, you put in a target a _Weapon Weakness_ Aspect, with one Free Invoke . You can use this Aspect as long you still worn the Robe. Even you fail this test, you still receive a _Weak Spot_ Boost, like if you tied the test.
