## Story

The first memory Jiminy can talk about is from the lab: 

The smell of bleach and almost blinding white. 

The _kindergarden_-like room.

All the computers and things he was put in front, to learn, and absorb like a spounge, all the knowledge.

He never knew why he was there, even where is his parents (considering he had ones, because he can't remember). He could not remember about his birthday and so on. 

All he could say is: he were be "grown" to be a weapon. The kind of, he never knew.

In his heart, somehow, there was a rebel flame, saying him: _"GET OUT FROM THIS HELL!!!"_

He had the chance when a power surge disabled his _"cradle"_ (as his captors called the room where he always stayed). He just catch the first clothes he could and ran away. Curiously, he discovered why those clothes where the kind it was: he was codenamed by his captor _Jiminy Cricket_, from _Pinocchio_'s fame. The dossier he took withb him said his powers were to be used to help troops at war fronts by coordinating his moves and to weaken the enemies' will by "calling to their heart".

Jiminy choose to take this as name (or at least as nickname) and to use his powers to (first) make a living somewhat, (second) fight for peace and (third) discover about his own past.

Jiminy is nowadays living into places he locates anonymously, doing some jobs to provide him money (normally working as IT consultant, but just online). He still uses just childish clothes, as his body looks like locked into an always infant mode. He normally dresses as _Disney_'s _Jiminy Cricket_. He is very smart, educated and philosophical, but many times he gets itself into tantrums, as he's not totally grown-up emotionally.

He uses Jiminy Cricket as name for two reasons: (1) he don't remember his real name (if he had one) and (2) ironically this is a very common nickname at Internet, which make him somewhat difficult to be found.
