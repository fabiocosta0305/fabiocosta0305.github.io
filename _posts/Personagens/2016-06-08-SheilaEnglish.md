The cat-men Numan is one of the most ancient and wise people in Umdaar. They are known by his extreme wisdow and loyalty to the free people of Umdaar. Obviously this make them clash directly with the Masters, and many of those of them captured are tortured and send to the arenas to be killed by beast or gladiators by populace's glee.

But even between them, time after time, there's some "free spirits", that don't accord with the traditions.

Sheila is one of those "free spirits".

Since her time with her litter, Sheila shown the signs of being not a common numan, being more impulsive and savage than normal. So, she became accomplished on the arts of tracking, lacerny and theft, until she grow enough to go and live her life by herself, for the joy of all, including herself.

With the time, she started to search and steal old Artifacts from the Demiurge's Age, which brought her under the Masters of Umdaar's radar.

She would already be eaten by an arena beast, if not by Shukul and the others.

She like the groups, but she have two issues with them.

First: she don't know the idea of property, taking what she want when she want when she want, even from her friends.

Second: she have issues with hierarchy, although clear explained and justified orders can be followed by her.
