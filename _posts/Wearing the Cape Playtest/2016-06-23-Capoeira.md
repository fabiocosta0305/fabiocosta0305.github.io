Samuel da Mata was successor from a school of the mixed dance and martial arts _Capoeira_, when during the Event he heard in his mind his patron Orisha, Xangô, calling him for protecting the poor. When his senses came back, he felt himself full of energy and used his new powers and agility to rescue as many people as he could. 

He did not like to assume the _gringo_ (foreigner) idea of a cape or costume. He use only the cotton shirt and pants, held in place by a pair of colored cords that represent his level at _Capoeira_. He is somewhat neutral with _gringos_, but he respect a lot the people from HWB and those with them
