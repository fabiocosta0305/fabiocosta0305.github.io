Wrestling fighting was a entertainment staple since the old ages, and pre-Event it was somewhat common. With The Event, some wrestlers undergone the breakthrough and formed in US their own league, Breakthrough WWE.

However, in Mexico, wrestling was more than entertainment: it was a cultural paradigm. _La Lucha Libre_ was formed based on the same basis than US Wrestling, but gained their contours in drama and style. The adoption of the Masks created a roster of fighters, heroes before the Event, like _El Santo_, _Cibernético_, _Psychosis_, _Silver King_ and _Doctor Wagner_. Splitted into _Tecnicos_ ("good guys" whose fighting style is focused into speed and technique) and _Rudos_ ("bad guys", focused into strenght and, in some case, dirty moves), they were so big heroes into mexican minds that the revelation of the real identity of one was so big a deal that, when _El Santo_ died in natural cases he was buried using his mask.

It's no wonder that, when some _Luchadores_ passed throught the breakthrough, they had turned into real-life heroes (and villains).

_Luchadores_ are very similar in style to Ajaxes, and combined with some of _Dragon_ moves. However, they have some idiossincrasies, like the _Style_, and _Mask_. Normally, the kind of breakthrough will dictate his _Style_ (_Tecnico_ or _Rudo_) and can be based on the _Mask_ (his secret identity). 

The _Mask_ is very important for _Luchadores_: A _Luchador_ don't use his powers without the _Mask_ (some says that is a kind of key between normal/hero identity), and some of them don't show themselves publicly without the _Mask_. This is so important that one of the biggest match a _Luchador_ can undergo is the _Lucha de Apuestas_, a kind of "fight to the death", where the defeated has his Mask taken off and destroyed by the winner. The psychological impact on a _Luchador_ is so big that many of them can't use their powers until they can create themselves a new Mask and persona. Curiously, almost all the _Luchadores_ are known only about their _Masks_: it's a kind of _Clark Kent_ effect.

## Invokes and Compels

_Luchadores_ are dictated by some kind of ethics, parts of them neither _Rudos_ would go against. 

_Luchadores_ can Invoke their Power Aspects by the same motives Ajaxes and Dragons, and can be compelled also by the same motive.

Also, _Luchadores_ tends to Invoke their Aspects to gather up _Kayfabe_, or the _suspension of belief_ that sometimes improve even more their feats.

However, _Luchadores_ can be Compelled to get into their own ethics while fighting (like only fight one-by-one and without weapons), and even they can be Compelled to the biggest match a _Luchador_ can undergo, _Lucha de Apuesta_, a somewhat "fight to the death" where the defeated has his Mask revealed, somewhat "killing" him as a hero (at least until he get back under a new _Lucha_ persona and Mask)

## Special Rule: Kayfabe

A staple for _Luchadores_, _Kayfabe_ was the term used in the entertainment pro-wrestling for the "belief" people had on the "reality" of the wrestling, including rivalties, relationships and so, taking the staged as true. In The Event era, _Kayfabe_ still works, and many _Luchadores_ call it _La Passion de La Lucha_ (The Passion for Wrestling). 

_Luchadores_ are known about being able to "gather power" from civilians next. The main ones, like _Santo de lo Siglo 21_ (The 21st Century Saint), are able to do things that even some _Omega-Class_ Ajaxes are not able to, when they are "pumped up". 

By spending of 1 Fate Point, they can bring up a _Kayfabe_ Aspect. While this 
Aspect is in game with a Free Invoke. Each time they do an Attack that is _Successful with Style_, they can reduce the damage in 1 and, instead of a _Boost_, receive an Free Invoke into _Kayfabe_. 

## Power Stunts

As said, _Luchadores_ can get all the Ajax and Dragon Power Stunts. And also they have their own Stunts.

+ _Luchador:_ this stunt is a staple, that shows they have a different fighting technique than the normal ones. By buying this, _Luchadores_ can use _Physique_ instead of _Fight_ while fighting bare-hands;
+ _La Passion de La Lucha:_ this _Luchador_ can do a test of _Fight_ (or _Physique_ if he has _Luchador_) to call upon _Kayfabe_ as a _Creat Advantage_ action;
+ _Rudo Technique:_ (**permission:** _Rudo Luchador_) _Rudos_ are known by their dirty moves and about trying to gain every edge they could to win. A _Rudo_ with this can, _once per session_, bring an _Dirty Move_ as an Aspect with a Free Invoke. It can be almost anything, like using _Hidden Weapons_ or throwing sand to _Blind up_ the enemies.
+ _Tecnico Techique:_ (**permission:** _Tecnico Luchador_) _Tecnicos_ are known by their flashy moves and about sticking to the rules of _La Lucha_. A _Tecnico_ can, _once per session_, if _Successful with Style_ into an Attack, cough up some _Extra Passion_ as an Aspect with Free Invokes equals half the number of shifts he reduces the attack damage (until Zero including; at least one, round up).
+ _Signature Move:_ (**permission:** Move/Technique Aspect ) every _Luchador_ has a special move, a Signature one that he uses as a finishing attack. _Once per session_, the _Luchador_ can use this move to do an Extra +2 on Attack _or_ adding +4 WR (choose on the Stunt acquiring). Some _Luchadores_ has more than one _Signature Move_.
+ _Famous Lineage:_ (__Permission:__ _Keyfabe_, Lineage shoud be indicated into Codename) Some _Luchadores_ are known by being part of Luchadores lineage that can be traced back to pre-Event times, in the beginnnig of _Lucha Libre_. Lineages like the _Santo_ (_Tecnico_) or _Silver King_ or _Doctor Wagner_ (_Rudos_) are traditions that would never fade away: as always there was a Superman, always will be a _Santo_. They receive +3, instead of +2, on their Power Aspect Invokes and _Kayfabe_ Invokes.

## Power Class Requirement

They are qualified as the Ajax-Type _or_ Dragon-Type. As they are somewhat both, they can _sum_ their levels. For example, if you qualify as a B-Class Ajax and a D-Class Dragon, he's a A-Type Luchador. However, there's no _Omega_ or _Ultra_ _Luchadores_.

## Variants

The US Wrestlers that are breakthroughs could go into the _Luchador_ type, if they develop enough _Kayfabe_. 

Japanese wrestlers from _puroresu_ can be qualified as _Luchadores_. There is at least one combo of _Luchador_ and _Sentai_, the _Great Kuma_, a _Sentai_ that was changed into a _Bear-like_ creature and fight for justice.

In many places around the world fighters with some kind of _Luchador_ appeared, and their flamboyant actions are known. Specially in France and England there was the surge of the _Swashbucklers_, heroes that are like _Luchadores_ although they use weapons like knives, rapiers and swords instead of their bare-hands. The _Parisien Mousquetaires_ (Paris' Musketeers) are knows of the main _Swashbucklers_ around the world, their flamboyant moves and panache making them powerful heroes.  Each of them is codenamed under one of the Musketeers from Alexander Dumas book, or on a kind of flamboyant codename. Their most recent recruit is _Lorenzo, le Citoyèn_ (Citizen Lorenzo), a expert rapierist that use a kind of Vernetech based cross of Musketeer rapier and _Star Wars_ lightsaber.
