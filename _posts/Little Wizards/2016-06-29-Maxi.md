Maxi came from Shivers island on Tails to learn more about Coinworld. 

His family send him around the world to learn about everything he could before goes back to help them on their potion-making business. As he had grown up somewhat away from society, in the dark Spooky Forest in Shivers, he is a little rude, and his clothes are normally torn, although clean, which is good: his family is intimately connected with skunks, as they live in a Shivers place called The Skunk Haven. 

He looks a lot like a skunk-kid, even with a big skunk tail, interrogation point shaped, black with white-stripes. He likes to go into the wilds and be in contact with nature, and dislike somewhat the sunlight. He likes to tell some spooky stories from his home, and sometimes he grows homesick, and this explains why he like to go near anyone who accept him and is extremely loyal to his friends, which he makes a lot.
