Sora's family is from a circus from Smiles archipelago where some have some Magical talent. When Sora had born with some unusual features, specially the unusual nose, round and red as a clown's, they chose to let her learn Magic, as unusual features normally shows the person has magical power or talent . The circus Magician, Presto (in fact a Mage)  had tutored her since she was 4, and then she had gone to a Magic School. 

She had not adapted herself, as many thought she was a Lil' sorcerer, not a Lil' Mage,  being bullied by her unusual appearance. She had drop the school out, and gone back to the circus and to homeschooling with Presto. But Presto convinced their family she needed to know the world.  So, her dad had give her the basics and send her to learn in the world. 

She's pathologically happy, and even when she fumbles things she gives a guilty smile. Her face is white and "painted" as the clown she is. She likes make people happy and wants to know everything around the world she can, so when she grows up she can open a magical circus school. She don't like to be alone or with boring people, but thanks to Horace, her shy rabbit familiar that stays the most of the time inside her big baggy hat, it's rare to her to be alone.
