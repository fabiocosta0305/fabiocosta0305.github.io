I had GMed yesterday _Wearing the Cape_ for two players: one with a [Bosnian _Dragon_ from Sarajevo called _Blackstar_](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Z5H3VTXQsAMg8UG6nOxEIGB9F9kBsoNM4ohucRE9XWg/edit?usp=sharing) and another with a [_Metamorph_ based on the game _Prototype_ called _Quimera_ (Chimera in portuguese)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B13x_ltL7x6ZNXdObVprU29ncWM/view?usp=sharing). I GMed the adventure [_The Verne Chieftain_](https://app.classeur.io/#!/files/fyMM9sigVVSvTfQHZhCr) I put sometime before here in the playtest community.

They came into Sierra Leone and were presented to _Roque Santeiro_ refugees' camp. There, Diana talked about their station, mission and so. Their first mission was something that was simple enough, escorting a convoy with supplies and new refugees for _Roque Santeiro_ from Freetown airport. They received the people and supplies from an Antonov cargo airplane comissioned by RAF (English _Royal Air Force_). _Blackstar_ did a check for seeing for spies and so, and she _tied_, so she received a Boost, that she used before an Conflict. 

Blackstar and Quimera left the normal warriors for the UN _Blue Berets_ and took chance against some D-Class Ajaxes. They had some problem, specially when Quimera Compel himself for a narrative detail, as he's a _Utopia Corporation Runaway Prototype_ , which I chosed to use by putting him under a more powerful stance based on Quimera background (she was used as an experiment with a Vernetech virus to give people powers). Anyway, they have not too much problems.

I decided to skip over the camp attack and go direct for the Investigation part of the adventure. Diana declared they where at _Class B Intervention Protocol_ and splitted the local HSF between the activity. Blackstar and Quimera started bby getting with a local tribe for clues. They had some problem, speciall they are Islamic and even Blackstar also being Islamic, she being a woman they didn't want to speak with her. Quimera (that although originally a _she_, now uses a masculine form) came in help and they did their way, taking a clue on for a local _Witch Doctor_ (a Merlin) that was selling the _Breakthrough Enhancer Drug_ (BED).

In the city, Blackstar had a _Success With Style_ into a Contact check, and she found an old time acquaintance, a _Weapon Smuggler_ that had gave her the clue about the Witch Doctor. When they came and tried to talk with him, they felt the consequence of a _Success with Cost_ in the tribe, when they were found and confronted initially by _Panther_, one of the _Elite Four_ for the main villain (they didn't know in the moment).

It was when Blackstar called that she would _"go first on the son, then on the father"_. I triggered _Panther_ Aspect, that changed into a leopard, and fought Blackstar... She was able to stop Panther, and we did the first negotiation: he turned into a _Double Agent_ for the players, and they provided him with an _Experimental retroviral_ for _Panther_'s daughter (that is infected by HIV). After receiving the _retroviral_, Panther talked and gave to the PCs clues about the _Elite Four_. 

Diana confirmed _Panther_'s info about the _Elite Four_ and they go for another of the _Elite Four_, _Kilimanjaro_, and they get into for _Kilimanjaro_'s tribe and family. While she was talking with _Kilimanjaro_'s family (at that time, Quimera's player had to get out the adventure, and Quimera was posted into _Roque Santeiro_'s security), the player had been _Successed with a Cost_, and Kilimanjaro shown herself and a conflict started. Although the thunderbolt she took straight in the chest, _Blackstar_ didn't fought and opened herself for _Kilimanjaro_ and she came for the reason. But he had did it via a _Success with a Cost_. I spared the cost for another time. 

By this, she discovered that Derek, the _Verne Chieftain_, had not be able to build another installation anyware to create _BED_ (because of the Vernetech). But anyway, _Kilimanjaro_ were up for helping.

Blackstar had able to discover _Derek HQ_ and they were ready for getting into. Blackstar had been put the infiltration team, with Diana, Corin, _Squirrel Girl_ (Lesley Dimantas, a medic and metamorph), and two extra heroes: [_Sugarplum_](http://fabiocosta0305.gitlab.io/characters/wtc/Sugarplum/), a Merlin with _Glamour_-based powers for illusion and elemental control, and [_Jiminy Cricket_](http://fabiocosta0305.gitlab.io/wtc/characters/JiminyCricket/), a 9-year kid with the strategist mind of a [Mastermind](http://fabiocosta0305.gitlab.io/wtc/Mastermind-Type/) and the power to call the good feelings over other's heart.

They started the inflitration andf have a first fight, but they had bad luck in the dice and, although won, they had taken some consequences. Next level, they were not the same luck and _Gave in_ after _Jiminy Cricket_ was took by one of the Super-Goons as part of a _Epic Fail_, and they were took to _Derek_'s main room.

There, it had a kind of _James Bond_ moment where Derek presented himself and gloated his plan for the Heroes, and also I revealed my on-hold Cost on the _Success with a Cost_ for Blackstar: Panther and his daughter and Kilimanjaro were _taken as hostages_. Then he sent them for a below level, there was a like of a _Thuderdome_ arena, where lots of Goons was put (I gave 4 for _Blackstar_), however she had more strategy and some help from _Diana_ and _Sugarplum_, while _Corin_ take the normal guys and _Jiminy Cricket_ used _Bellax Analytica_ to help the team. 

They had found a way to get back Kevin's room and they did a big negotiation, with help of _Jiminy Cricket_ with his _Pretty Please_ power. They could not fight back because Panther and Kilimanjaro and Panther's daughter were still hostages. But _Blackstar_ with the help of _Jiminy Cricket_ they convinced (by taking a _Success with Style_) to surrender himself, after all (she could not win HSF heroes by himself). 

In the end, we had some critics about the system:

+ The _Opposition Dice_ in opposed rolls left me (as a Narrator) without some options for the _GM Cheat_ for when things get over and potentially goes wrong. Maybe in conflict the GM should have the idea to "roll on screen" Defense. For other actions, like Investigations, this sounds very cool, but in conflicts the letallity level goes really amok;
+ I felt also a little complex to solve damage on-the-fly, if I don't not the WR/AR previously, so it's somewhat difficult to create on-the-fly mooks;
+ In the character creation, a good thing should put the "normal" Stunts near the Power Stunts, maybe after the Type descriptions;
+ The Powers are somewhat mismanaged (you see Heavy Hitter either as a _Power Stunt_ for Ajaxes and as a "common" stunt);
+ Maybe you could create more Power Stunts and put them on a group of "common" Power Stunts, like you did for _Superhuman Attribute_ and things like that.
+ As a tip, I think the Sentinels should goes into a Appendix.

The setting was considered a good point by the group, although some of the guys thought the setting could be not that directed for a "thing". But they loved the _Roque Santeiro_, and all the things. They loved the setting, but the thing was a little with the system, but we thought (all) there's lots of potential (I didn't was part of Phase I playtest, so we could not say how much the system changed).
