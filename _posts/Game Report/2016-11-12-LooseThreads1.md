## Events

I'm running now the _Pecked to Death_ adventure from the _Loose threads_ book.

Everything started when I used _Shimmer_'s Stunt ___First Star I See Tonight___ (that allows her to detect Desires - even _Heart's Desire_ - almost instantaneously) to say that someone needed help. They got into the local city and was found by _Elda's Aide and Maid_ that conducted The Company to Elda's house. Julian chose to take guard while the others entered the Room. Contessa Sara had started to talk with Elda about what happened, and that had somewhat Compelled her into her Tension, as she is torn between the Truth that she need to discover about who she really is (beside here mother's training), or the "Lies" about her being a Contessa and so. I pushed it to the _Truth_, as she saw she had a lighter fate than Elda, although she had some time with an abusive mother and so. But although she saw this, they negotiated for the reward for the mission.

Everything checked, Sara and the others gone to the Castle to talk with Marra, Elda's stepsister and Queen of that Kingdom (I'm working the setting into a _Hercules/Xena_ system, a.k.a. _Monster of the Week formula_). Marra talked her version and explained that she left the cottage were Elda lives for her and paid from her resources for the Aide, She gave the _glass shoe_ for the Company to help them to find the Fairy Godmother. As the (in theory at least) more powerful magic user in the Company, Shimmer was the responsible to use the _glass shoe_ to find the way into The Dark Forest for the Company. Before getting into the Forest, Sara used an Aspect to describe herself disguising as a sheperdess and heard a little about _Parlament of the Rooks_...

That eased somewhat things for them, so I put a battle for them with a big bear after _Prático_, a little paranoid, had made a ___Bird expelling whistle___ (he was enough on that m\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-ing birds on that m\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-ing forest!). However, _Fang_ (Julian was already "sacked" from the Company, turned into a NPC and stayed in the City) had no problem to, even after being hit by a Sneak Attack from the bear, hit him wit just one hit and take it down, making it run away... In the meantime, they heard some chirps in the forest, but Sara chosed to just forget the chirps and go for the Fairy Godmothers' Conclave. 

They found a glade with some Gypsy-like wagons, and then they found Miriva. Sara and the others talked a little with her, and Sara accepted ___The Promise___ to ___Help Iron Henry___. With this, Miriva made the ___Protection Amulet___ that was given to Shimmer.

However, they were found by the other Fairy Godmothers, that, as ___Stubborn___ and torn between _Judgement_ and _Caregiving_, chosed to avoid that that pesky Genie (Shimmer) and those Mortals (the others) could get out with some of their secrets without passing into the ___Professional Dilemma___. Prático, that has an Aspect against magic, had chosed to go against the _Leader of the Godmothers_, and she hit him into Prático's tension, that he pushed to _Vendetta_, and she put him into a ___Curse___, turning him into a ___REAL, snorting, oinking, four-feet, pig___ (in the setting I was considering Prático and Fang as anthropomorphic half-human, half-animal beings) as a way to make him a little more humble (although the player wants to build, someway, a exoskeleton for his oinking form... without magic). _Shimmer_ thought into the Alladin experience and solved the ___Professional Dilemma___ for the group, and they where free to go, althought she was one of the only people into all the adventure that talked Sara's name without the honorific she gave for herself as ___Contessa___. 

The Company get out the Conclave, all of them but Shimmer very pissed off with the _Leader Fairy Godmother_, but with the amulet. Now they need to get back into the City...

... and also deal with Sara's Promise and Prático's Curse.
