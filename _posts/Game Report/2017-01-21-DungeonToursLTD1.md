I've run a playtest game yesterday at a local RPG event called _Dungeon Geek Weekend_. I GMed the playted Adventure _The Lil' Lord Fiztroy Job_, using the sample PCs Throk and Spanner, also the Halfling Rogue (that was called _Vahn_)  and two PCs I created by my own, Fezair the Elf Illusionist and Gossamer the Gnome Loremaster. They had been called by Gertie and accepted the job.

<!-- excerpt -->

While talking with the Lil' Lord Fitzroy (Fezair and Gossamer were the ones that had gone for Negotiation), Gossamer introduced the _Legend of the Return of the Demon Lord_ that every thousand years tried to get back to their world. By doing this, they discovered some of the _Hidden Talents_ and _Requirements_. To be exact, he wants to _Live a Adventure Worthy of Ballads_, _Have a shiny new Rapier and know to use it (I guess)!_, _Want to disable traps!_, _Love to fight Lizardmen, they are so IN_, and _Dislikes Darkness and Dirty_. They also tried to cough more money, and were _Successful with a Style_ in the process, working a 3-Invoke _Resources_ Aspect.

Then, they layout'ed the Dungeon, with some _Skeletons_ and _Lizardmen_, some _Traps_, a _Golem_ and the _Demon-Lord_ at the end of it. In fact, a kind of Medieval Era Megazord, a Fake Threat that was the only focus of Spanner during the preparation phase. Gossamer, although a Loremaster, would be the one that would "teach" Lord Fitzroy "how to fight" and about the "Demon-Lord Lore" (gaining time for the rest of the party to ready the dungeon).

Vahn set up the traps (except one Fake one of Darts, that Fezair setup) and obtained also a Gelatinous Cube and a Carrion Wurm, to be used as a way to maintain the Dungeon clean and as a "Random Encounter" if things were slowing down (or otherwise, as they'll shown after).

Fezair helped by obtaining some clothes and putting some magic illusions on some orc mercs contracted by Throk to be the "Lizardmen", and also provided the skeletons by talking with some contacts (including a Lich and a ex-Mage turned Idol). Also, in the setback he was the one that had to setup the Darts trap, but with this forgot to setup the Golem (I gave them the _Fake Golem Illusion_ , but without Free Invokes, by a FP burnt by Fezair during the Tour).

Throk contracted lots of orcs to be the _"Lizardmen"_. In the Setback, while Throk was bringing the orcs to the Dungeon, to be ready, a Griffon had came and attacked the orcs, but with a _Success with a Style_ in an Attack Throk defeated the Griffon bare-hands. In the end, he brought a _Somewhat Battered Griffon_ as a extra Real Threat in the what we called _Room 0_, before entering the Dungeon. 

As a convention game, I took a little less rooms, with 7 as a start, and including the "Room 0" at the Dungeon entrance, the Dungeon turned this way:

+ __Room 0 (Real):__ A _Somewhat Battered Griffon_ at the Dungeon Entrance
+ __Room 1 (Real):__ Some _Skeletons_, controlled by Vahn (that was the one in the _Backstage_)
+ __Room 2 (Fake):__ A Corridor with a _Blunt Shaped, but otherwise real-looking, arrows_ Trap
+ __Room 3 (Fake):__ The _Golem Illusion_ hiding stairs for Dungeon Level 2 
+ __Room 4 (Fake):__ An _Fake Hole Trap_ that would send them into a pool of water in the Dungeon Level 2, _scary, but safe_
+ __Room 5 (Real):__ The _Lizardmen Cultists (in fact, Orc Mercs)_ that where protecting the only thing that could "defeat the Demon-Lord", an _Shiny, yet Fake, Cerimonial Dagger_
+ __Room 6 (Fake):__ a _Closing Wall Room_ (in fact, Corridor), but set to _stop at the final moment_
+ __Room 7 (Real):__ the final challenge of the _Medieval Megazord Demon-Lord_

They had worked into quality instead of quantity and almost all the Rooms had more than 2 Free Invokes, Except the _Griffon_ (that was a last time addition) and the _Golem Illusion_ that Fezair forgot to work.

In Gossamer's Setback (I gave each one a setback), the Lord Fitzroy choosed to "go" and Gossamer had to stop him, and so he played a gentlemen, but serious, swordfight against him (as a Contest) and won easily, so he provided the party the time for the last efforts.

Then, it was time for the Tour, but Fitzroy came with Contessa, his sister, and James, his butler (I chosed in my mind to put James as a second _Cynic_, but a more quiet one, as he _Would like to see Fitzroy really grow_). Throk very soon found about the _Familiar hate_ Aspect on Contessa, and they were already aware of the unidirectional familiar feud  from Contessa from the Lord Lawrence Fitzroy (they asked a first name, I gave). They felt that the Lord Fiztroy was a Childman, but the was a manipulative pain in the ass, ready to anything for power (including using the PCs).

The tour run very well, passing through the Griffon and the Skeletons, and the Darts. In the hole trap, he "disarmed" the trap (with Fezair using a little cantrip without Fitzroy or the others noticing). Then, Throk (that was the Guardian) simulated a shameful run to the Golem room, and they found Throk "hurt" (scening the hurt by the _Golem Ilusion_) and the Lord Fitzroy hit the Illusion, making the "Golem" collapsing with his rapier.

In Level 2, they had a problem: the water pool room was in the way, and then they choose to release the Gelatinous Cube as "Random Enconter" and accepting a defeat, making Lord Fitzroy run away. Then, I set the Twist: Contessa had chosed to show that all this was a setup (in fact, in my mind, she was trying to use the PCs to kill Lawrence and then she would frame the PCs), and found the "backstage" where Vahn was taking back the Gelatinous Cube. 

They chose to create a illusion (by using the _Hearing Bud_ to ask Fezair to do this) of a room to hold Contessa during the Tour. Even with the big difficult, he was _Successful with Style_, and Contessa was took by an Illusion of the Gelatinous Cube and the Carrion Wurm trying to devour her (in fact, the players said they were cuddling like little kitten on her) and she fell out. I gave them her as a _Last Sacrifice_ for the _Medieval Megazord Demon-Lord_. 

As the Contessa left a _blood-colding scream_, the PCs convinced Lawrence to stay focused in defeat the Demon-Lord, saying that their Cultists took her as a _Sacrifice_. So, they came to the _Lizardmen Cultists (in fact, Orc Mercs)_ room and fought the Orcs, and them Fitzroy (even more focused and excited) had defeated the "Cultist" and obtained _Shiny, yet Fake, Cerimonial Dagger_. 

And so, there was only the Demon-Lord, or so the Lord Fitzroy thought, as there was the  _Closing Wall Corridor_. The PCs almost "was caught", but Fitzroy had disarmed the trap (it was planted into a way he could find by himself) and "saved" the party from a squishy death (or so he thought).

And then all that was left was the Demon-Lord room... And the _Medieval Megazord Demon-Lord_ with a _Last Sacrifice_ (Contessa) and some "Cultists" (to make Fiztroy "win the day"). Fitzroy fought and then the Fake Dagger was melted (as it was made of sugar, that melted with all the head freed by the "Fireballs" and "Fire Pillars" and so built by Spanner). Then, Fezair used a illusion to make some runes appears over the Demon-Lord to dispel him (in fact, the selfdestruction words set by Spanner) and he invoked the words, dispelling the Demon-Lord.

Fitzroy saved Contessa (that was safely placed by Vahn into a fake cerimonial altar), that was scared like hell and now developed a _Uncontrollable Fear of Jellies (eatable or not)_. Fitzroy was so impressed by the Tour (8 Successes, only a Defeat for the Random Encounter) that gave them a good money for the Tour... Part of them they spent with the orcs in a big party and the rest they split, with Spanner wanting to creat a new _Megazord Demon-Lord_, this time that could be split into _Five Mini Demon-Lords_...

They loved the setting and they really liked how to build the Dungeon and set things. They had lots of fun dealing with Contessa and thinking on if they should kill her or not or get into their feud and so. And also they had very fun while narrating how Fitzroy fought the Cultists and the Skeletons and specially the Demon-Lord. They also had many fun in all the process. We had also talked on suggestions in rules, that I'll put into a revised copy of the  DTl playtest. 

Think the product is fun and give a twist for traditional Dungeon Crawl adventures, and has potential for other kind of pseudo-heist things, like a salaryman that would want to get into a cyberpunk run without armors or cyber (maybe with a locked deck) and so, and even with more "benign" kinds of tours, like a lord that wants to take her good-for-nothing son and teach him a lesson.

I'm really satisfied on the result of thre playtest... Still needs, although, to test some rules, like using flaws in the _Hearing Buds_ and play another ideas in the game. Maybe I'll do some more games of DTL.
