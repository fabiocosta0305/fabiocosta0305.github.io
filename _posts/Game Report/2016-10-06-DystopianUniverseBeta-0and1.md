We had two sessions in one: Session 0 for creating _La Resistence_ and The Government and setting first secrets (as they created their characters by their own), and Session 1 (a _try the waters_ simple adventure).

First of all, we created _La Resistence_. As Paulo's characters hates the VR by some backstory, the players setted the ___Manifesto___ to ___From_ Le Treillis _to_ L'Apoogée, _we'll bring people back to Reality___, so they want to disrupt totally the society stratification and the isolation that the _Le Treillis_ provokes into people from reality.

To the ___Weakness___, they chosed ___Very few, very apart, many agendas___ to see that, at least from the start, there's not exactly one great Resistence, but groups that are scattered and set apart, each one trying to push their own agenda aside _La Resistance_'s one... and even about them.

For the starting _Advancements_, they chose (one each) _Hijacked Shipments_ and _Hearts and Minds_. This was fun for me as GM.

Then, we got for _The Government_, and then they chose as ___Slogan___ ___For a safer Paris Nouveau___. And then we came for the ___Scandal___, where I take a page from William Shatner's _Tekwar_, thanks by Paulo, with her character introducting the idea of VR being a kind of disease, even an addiction, like a drug (think also on _Dune_'s Semuta addiction). So, we put the ___Scandal___ as ___AR/VR: an real addiction, and a very lucrative one___

Then, we came to the Government's _Advancements_ and the PCs chose _Surveillance Optimization_, and I had forgot it totally in the first Session, or else I would turn PCs life hell. And I've took _Infrastructure Investiment_, so I can cash things in the Bank so I can milk it later in the campaign.

We had some difficult in next step, setting _Secrets_, as there was just two players and we had to put some extra secrets so the secrets could be not deductables, but using Google Hangouts had worked okay. We're using Roll20 (for maps and rolls), Hangouts (for chat, recording - via Youtube Live - and screen sharing), Google Spaces (for information exchaging) and Classeur (for notetaking, adventure controls and so), so they'll creating the secret details via Classeur and share with me.

As we got fast into Session 0 (as they had read the playtest documents - after signed the pledge), we got into _Warehouse Raid_. They had to go into _Georges Méliès_'s tomb at Pere-Lachaise's Cemetery to get for their first mission for _La Resistance_, each one getting by themselves. Then, _Jean-Jacques_ had ___compelled___ himself into the _La Resistence_'s _Weakness_ to be wary on  _Remy_, and I've compelled _Remy_ as _Cityoen_, as they treat Naturals like Jean-Jacques, and they had some clash on talking about trust and so, until I put the NPCs to talk them about the mission: _Said_, an Armiger tripodded guy from Arab ascendance with a GLaDOS-like voice and his "sidekick" somewhat, _Leandra Vazaios_, an Natural that, although being a little more than a child, is respected by _La Resistence_ and is _The last humanity link_ for Said.

Leandra made the presentations and talked about the mission. Also, to describe Said I compared it to the people near _Cyberpunk 2020_'s cyber-psychosis. And she presented the mission and talked about their loyalties. To turn things even worse, I mentioned indirectly to Jean-Jacques's secret. They are accusing each other on mistrust, but Jean-Jacques asks about the warehouse, and Leandra presented a ___Blood-soaked, dirty, scrawled Installation Map___. As they tried to analyse the map in secret, Said put them _In Target_, just in case they run. The Map also had some information about AR/VR connection and information for Remy as Hacker to use to invade and try to do things  to mess with the AR/VR in the place.

They accept the mission, after a menace exchange between _Jean-Jacques_ and Leandra, including Leandra giving Said's _Last humanity link_ with her. And so they went for the _prep scene_.

Remy had created a set of _fake matedata_ that could be useful to spoof security systems and so, while _Jean-Jacques_ studied the _Schedules and Methods_ of Sun Systems Biotech's warehouse. And then they had gone for the mission.

_La Resistance_ provided a _Van with fake metadata_ so they could enter the warehouse easily. And Remy had _spoofed her metadata_ to get undetected so she could hack the security systems. They had lots of good rolls and they had took lots of _boosts_ on rolls, and so I had few _blowback_ to use against them. They had entered and a ___Group of Disguised Naturals___ from La Resistence came to turn things more correctly.

Remy plugged herself into the local systems network to spoof things and counter the security systems without problems. She had a good result, and spoofed the _Security Systems_ to ___avoid detection___ and to use it for them. I tried to launch a clue on something I called ___Project ET-01___ that the hakcer discovered on the warehouse inventory. Jean-Jacques asked for a _cargo manifest_ that could be used to clean things up, and Remy was very succesful to create the manifest. 

They filled the van and then Jean-Jacques got near the Security Commander, _Guard Captain Rodriguez_, and they used a boost for a reroll. With a _Sucess with Style_, he humiliated himself to Rodriguez for he to sign the fake cargo manifest, and he was successful on this. Jean-Jacques discovered that Rodriguez was the one who need to sign the manifesto so they can get out without problems. Jean-Jacques used the _Schedules and Methods_ and the _Cargo Manifest_ boosts to ease things to get for Rodriguez. This was the moment I thought things was so easy. 

Jean-Jacques had entered the room and Rodriguez did a snob look, but Jean-Jacques stayed on his cool. Although he was very agressive, he _signed the manifest_. They looked for a _safe_ and Remy captured a photo of it via the hacked security system. Jean-Jacques get out with the _signed manifest_, and they got out the warehouse...

It was too easy, so I _compelled_ on a _Jean-Jacques_' _Being Human is More Important than live_ Aspect and was negated. But Remy suggested for an compel on her Aspect _The Plague Doctor_ (her fame in the Datasphere) to make her left a message and they were detected after. They had crossed with a _Corvid Economics_ convoy (my idea was to put them into the _Convoy Ambush_ mission, although it had happened somewhat). They tried to detract the van, either in real life and into AR/VR. 

They decided, in the end, to empty the van and bring the supplies to _La Cave_, and to forfeit the van. While emptying the van, they had a _Success into a Minor Cost_, so I chose to make them left ___A Way Opened to_ La Cave__, but they left the van into neutral and had a ___Success into Style___ to made the van get into the Siene. The ___Way Opened to_ La Cave__ was left unscatched, but I considered the _Gerdame_ didn't wanted to get with more problems (like I've Conceded the _Convoy Ambush_, with a total 4 Fate Points for the Bank). And this was the mission ending, going to _debrief_.

As I've not used the FPs for the mission, and so I received 2 FP for the Bank (by the _Investing in Infrastructure_ Advance). As receive 6 Advancement Points for the Mission (they were spotted and the alarm was called). Then I started the debrief, with Leandra being a little uneasy with them, and Remy accused Leandra of double-crossing them, and Leandra accused Remy of intentionally marked the AR/VR to alert the government, with Jean-Jacques also supporting her into a tration accusation.

I put them the options for Remy: ___clean her name___, ___getting double___ or ___sacrifice___. Remy's player had chose to ___clean her name___, revealing she did this because ___she fell in love for Said___ (didn't choose if this will be mutual). Then Remy explained she tried to impress Said. Jean-Jacques lost all his Advancement and I received an automatic advance.

They had took 10 Resistance Advancement Points, so they took an extra Advance, and they learned their lesson by choosing ___Training Archive Access___ to ease for themselves next missions.

For myself, I took an extra Government Advance (by Remy's ___cleaning her name___) and put her _Secret Attraction_ back the Secrets Deck and Remy's player took for a new secret. He took it and them we ended the session.

I think the worst was to manage all the pools involved: Advancement Points for Resistance/Government, Blowback, Bank, etc... But I think this was because it was a first time, and in next session I'll be better on this. I also had problem to obtain blowback to escalate things, but chose to save them for next missions.

Unfortunately I can't pass on more about PCs and so, because we're using things in Portuguese... But if they want some extra info, I can always put them for you into for resource links if you want, things like gameplay video, character sheet and so. 

Anyway, it was fun and people understood the idea on cyberpunk and also so on. Hope to play more adventures. It was incredible, albeit the difficults. The player liked the idea that everything is growing: _La Resistence_, The Government, the players, everything. The system was fast and funny and left space to guide things up easily.
